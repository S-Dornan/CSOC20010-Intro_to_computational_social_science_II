look at my precious girls
Do any of you know what kind of shoes chaeyoung was wearing?
I'm sorry but Momo's dancing is just a lot better than the other girls.  The way she pops her hip @0:52  and rolls her shoulders @1:00 is captivating and I hope she knows someone out there appreciates it!
https://strawpoll.com/h7er7hh6  Once Vote for Twice   fighting
Love TWICE and i love this song and dance,  but JIHYO looks like a ghost
only Chaeyoung wore a pair of leather shoes
omg views are freaking high!!!! Streaming too
Momo the dancing queen !!!Imagine how will she dance in Rihanna BBMAS song .the one blackpink debuted with. I bet momo will do it so much better!!!!especially that arm swing in  bbmas!!
twice the best dance and momo, dahyun , sana so prety
Yal, please notice jihyo, shes seriously an amazing damcer if you didnt know just focus on her facial expressions and accuracy of steps like serious  Id say the power isnt fully there but really for a vocalist and generally an idol her dance is really good like  No kiding
Is it just me, or does Nayeon just look really pissed the entire time 😂
Am I the only one that's love this song? I like it so much more then knock knock
2:31 look at jeongyeon. But it's ok!! I love you Jeongyeon. Waaaahhhh!!!😍😍
Momo killed this
i love ji hyo !!!
wow !! Momo is so very energetic in this video...
New to Twice so bear with me lol   Who the girl with the blonde hair and the girl with the long, straight, black hair?    But especially the girl with the really short (bob like haircut)  I couldn't keep my eyes off her the entire dance. 
lindas  i'm brazilian i love TWICE MY NAME IS CAROL
After 3 days of continuous practice, I finally got the whole dance :))
Love you day from good exo as to indigo on day sometimes 1N2D

i will dancing like that.and i must watching this video!!!Spirit!!😊😄
sana emphasised 'when love at first sight don't work, second sight sure does'.
I am so happy to see so many Jihyo comments! She is very underrated! Jihyo looks amazing here 💓💓💓
at the end u hear all there breathing while tzuyu is just like 'bitch i aint tired {insert sassy black woman mhmm}'
already got the dance down but its hard d:
I think Dahyun deserves more stans.
the most biutifull is mina and tzuyu and nayeon and momo and sana
Twice:let's all wear pants and not tell jeoyeong   Jeoyeong:what the heck 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Aesthetic: Twice~ ...i cant stop watching \u003c3
Is that what you call dancing? 😝😝 No definitely not 😂👎
No wonder why blackpink lisa said 'Momo is her ideal dancer and the best dancer' in a radio show!!Momi the dancing queen !!go girl !!

Chewy the flying heart    AND WE ARE WEARING PANTS AND NOT TELLING JEONGYEON AGAIN
is it just me or whenever momo dances with other mombers , i see no difference . i'm not being biased , but i swear i can see nothing difference when momo dances with the others . but i do like when she dances alone . you knoww .. before debut , when she cover ' problems ' from ariana grande . i love that onee (MY FAV. its legit awesome💞) . and when she covered my house from 2pm . you can see her energy but its *just* rlly different when she dance alone and with the members :( (?)
Why nobody talks about how cute and talented dahyun is? Too adorable
Daebak ! I like Sana's Part because it's cute and Many Hearts..This Song is very Cute..I love it !! When I'm boring I dance it to my room and my mom and dad are laughing. My mom says 'You're Crazy' HAHA ! I have a younger brother..He's 7 years old..He likes the song of Twice..He likes Sana, He says she's going to Korea to see Sana 😂😂
When you want to dance to this, but you need the other 8 to not feel awkward xD
The ominous breathing at the end
I'm in love with Tzuyu's classy style.
chae young is so ugly in the world she is filling cute but she is not cute.
jungyeon is over there getting her stuff on. GO JUNGYEON fighting
am I the only one who can't do the 'signal hand' gesture with my left hand? my little finger can't stand straight if the other three fingers go down. TT
Who agrees TWICE should do a ASMR practice room version of Signal?  I think it will be very awesome
Omg. Im a filipino. I love twice  so. Much in. The. cellpone i watch many songs
I looove you TWICE
i tried to focus on the dance but end up only looking at beautiful Nayeon with that red hair!  😍
Is it weird that i love the sound of their shoes?....
MARIMAR DELA CRUZ I like it too. 😂 I think you're OK
They are so hard to jump And neatly≧ω≦
*oml ONCE are awesome even this video views gaining a lot 😻😻😻*
momo love u.
My eyes are fixed on Sana 😍
Next time try to use colorful shirts so I can see very well because if your shirts are white and the background are white and your skin is white how can we see very well
Uploaded on my birthday.
idk about y'all my style is heavily influenced by twice's casual style in dance practices!
Keep up the good work Twice my bias/Role model is Jihyo.🤗☺
am i the only one who watch mina all the time?😂
I tried to dance this  and I failed
I love Sana and Nayeon and tzuyu and dahyun
gosh naeyon from now you look pretty ,but all of you twice are pretty.
How are you?
this stupid go watch blackpinks dance practise u will go crazy
ruthless freak why dont you go kys? lmao your weeb ass probably would
I can't stop watching Dahyun, she's so pretty.   That and the fact that her converse got me hypnotized lmao
I'm back here for the 39,901...and I enjoy it💛💛💜💜
i love twice
why people keep saying that jihyo is fat??her thighs fit the skinny jeans lol.
I love Momo's body
love you twice 😘😘💕💕💞👍💟💗👏👏👏👏👏👏
we finally have a jihyo era. but when will jeongyeon and chaeyoung's era come???
Who else ships Kai and Momo together? They should do a collab
awwww. Daehyun looks adorable as usual
I love how they dance wew
momo nailed it 😘
Fuck! they look like shiiittts!
then what are you? a toilet bowl
is this mirrored?

why don't JYP improve the sound quality on these practice videos\u200b and remove background noise? Not Twice's fault. other groups practice vids better produced eg. Blackpink.
Actually I love Nayeon's hair color in this video!!! ❤️😍😘😊☺️❤️
Help twice to 1Mil Subs
3:01 i live to see Dahyun's flying dab
Does anyone know what kind of pants Momo is wearing? I love them so much!
i love the japanese memebers so much, the Lovely MOMO, the elegant MINA and the clumsy SANA
I'm sone but I want to say that their choreography are became extreme
Any Sana fans, or is it just me? also Jeongyeon ❤❤❤
2:31 i see you jeongyeon i see you, what a cute mistake
You guys are great!!🤣 Keep working hard!!          P.S. I love the girl in the back with the red hair!!XD
momo does the choreo so  effortlessly. .....queen!!
I don't can download why???
i can't take my eyes of Sana and her hair
I love Tzuyu beacuse: she so cute and she sing a song good
Sana is so pretty❤︎  you think so too,don't you????????
Sana is so underrated. I can't take my eyes off her 😍😍😍
too occupied. boring to watch.
Fun fact: All of Twice was worried about if Signal would do well or not... except for Sana. watching this video, I can tell she LOVES this song/dance!! She's so energetic throughout and I love it 😍
Momo killing me at 1:03.. she look so cute. You deserve to get 999999999999999+ fans xD xD
Are they prettier in dance & practice video or in concert?        Both of it looks good btw.
Y'all that's a lot of girls. They need a bigger practice room. JYP, move your ass.
I love TWICE
this is so amazing  dance practice in twice signal
Is Momo the one with the short brown hair and gray top?
What's the name of the girl with the light hair and the yellow and white sweatshirt? I'm in love already, haha. 💛
y say that to my crush and she don't care 😢  T.T
Fantastic! So many hours of practice and hard work. I just want to hug them all so much!💓💓💓
momo dance so powerful😊  love it😚😍  all member so beautiful😘😘
Idk how people can hate them their so precious 😭🖤
Momo looks so hype in this choreo. She slay every beat!
You are the best!
*Jeongyeon almost hit the wall*
If JYP give TWICE more hard dance, I think they can do this.  Maybe everyone so hate TWICE that they can't see TWICE' talent.
When i watched this for thr first time i never heard the noises like claps and that but when i watched it for the second time i heard all the sound...  Wonder why...🤔
Mina love me
i love twice so much...............
The dance is so fast but they did it nicely ! good work girls 💓
Okay. I see you, Momo. Stop slaying me pleaaaaase.    Those movements are getting sharper every comeback. 💚👽
All of the girls are good, but Japan line are the best dancers
Dahyun is my bias😍💓
I have a hard time finding you guys
They are pretty
i love twice♥♥♥
I love this choreography 😀😍😍😍😍😍😘😚
Ohh! This is cool😂  Why is dahyun on the first line on the song? lol  Mostly, Nayeon has the first line and in the center line  lol so different, but cool tho😍💖
not expecting how different this choreo than the previous choreo! IMPROVE YOURSELF, GIRLS!
I love you♡
i love chaeyoung's outfit!!
Ok no joke, Mina's hair in the video is PERFECT💙
at 2:30 i saw jeongyeon step wrong. haha cute my bias
i love all member,so cute😍😍😘😘 BUT my bias Nayeon,Tzuyu,and jihyo ,i love them😊 Nayeon cute bunny,and i love voice her,and Tzuyu body kill me😍 she's so sexy,and beautiful,and jihyo voice I like too,When highnote jihyo,I smiling😊....This song so catchy,and Make me happy,With dances SIGNAL👀💀👽💋💋💋
I love it
I just had a big fight with my youngest brother,he is so disrespectful these days and everyone in the house is backing him up while I am the one who took the blame..I hate this condition and no,i am not in my teens but i am 22 and yes i still fight with my siblings..I just want to confess my dissatisfaction here😔😔 i just wonder if Twice members ever fight with their siblings or any of you guys ONCE here? 😔
twice oh my gosh!!
I live for twice in casual outfit 😍
I recorded a dance cover of this & it's on my channel, it was fun af. I love TWICE ♡
omg where's dahyun?😂
Im allowed to have dreams right?
Well so what if their dance is not as difficult as the other groups? At least their choreo is unique, very neat despite having 9 members, and their movements ARE SHARP AF *.*
ugly in the dace
Did you notice Jeongyeon at 2:31 Hahaha!
Tzuyu rocks any kind of clothes \u003c3 They all look really pretty though.TWICE is a visual group with unique talents! \u003c3 :D
Momo slaying me as always 💕💕
They made all the possible hearts I could think of
MiMo at the beginning and end, Jeongyeon and Chaeyoung (1st verse), Nayeon's Part, Mina (2nd verse) are the most tiring ones. I recommend learning these parts first to make things easier! Good luck everyone~ 😍💕💖🍭

did the stomping noise satisfy anybody else?
signal and tt are my guilty pleasure songs.
Watch Tzuyu hit the Glass 0:57
I can do it all apart from chaes last line before jihyo begins the bridge with the wired ass arms like bih wtf is thaT
I used to Love Them \u003e Hate Them \u003e Love Them  \u003e Hate Them Fully \u003e LOVE THEM FULLY
I like this choreo so much, I'm sooo gonna learn this
sorry for the other member but it's Momo era she is a good dancer and pretty i can't stop looking at her 😍
Can someone name one girl who watches this and doesn't feel terrible about herself?
We have  a event on our school and me and the other mebers of my group is picking what should we imitate the blackpink or twice!???😭😭😭😭 im a multifandom thats why i cant pick!!😭
77k left for 1M subscriber...fighting once💪💪💪...please promote twice more😘
Is it me or is Momo trying a bit too hard? ;) poor floor she smashed it xD
I don't get how you can have the nerves to come all the way to this video to dislike it. I mean you heard the song before this video came out right? So there is no use in clicking onnit sinc eyou know you won't appreciate it. Then why must you come and spread hate when you know it makes nobody happy. UUUUUUGH  I think that song is fantastic, very catchy and the dance is adorable. Keep it up Twice!
I love sana♡♡
i love twice！！！！！！😍😍😍😍
I was scared for Jeongyeon's head at 2:22 😭
2:30 Jeongyeon looked so cute when she messed up! And like a queen she comes back. I love them all.
Oh my gosh twice you're so beautiful I love you and I love all of your songs signal knock knock TT  cheer up I love them all
Having every member as your bias in twice is so hard bc you have to watch one time for all of them and 9 more times for each member X)
Who is the girl with red hair?
why is no one talking about chaeyeon and those pants and how good her legs look in them \u003c3
I'm actually kinda impressed with the dance. This comeback was a hit but since Blackpink also made their comeback they got the attention after they released their song.     Twice get's hate for their easy choreo but tbh Bp's choreo is not any harder. Like the choreo for whistle was probably easier than signal and the choreo  for as if its your last wasn't hard either. BP have a lot of hand gestures in their songs so I don't get why all the hate goes to Twice and believe me I'm not trying to protect twice. I'm not even a fan of them but it's sad how fans are so biased. Even if I have a bias group or member I will always say the truth.  I'm not a fan of twice but I hope fans (spcially blinks) will stop saying twice is shit when bp don't have hard choreo's either. But yes I admit BP have better rapping and we all know that.    But Red velvet is having a comeback so they are gonna bring some cool dancing. Buttttt the dancing queens (Gfriend) are *also* having a comeback and they are known for their killer dance and dance breaks. But anywaysss let's support all the groups, not spread hate, not be biased towars the ones we love but just support them.
I like chaeyoungie's leather pants here❤️😍😍so Sexy
Do you guys notice jungyeon @ 2:31 she made a mistake.. but still gets away with it.
Momo is awesomeeee \u003c3
i love them so much
nayeon's breathing at the end tho XD she's very exhausted lol
so nice this song

damn... must be hard to consistently fit for any perfomance  superb
i think this song is silly really i love twice but i didn't liked this song who agrees?
who's you're favorite in twice? comment......  1 jihyo  2 nayeon   3momo  4tzuyu  5dahyun  6sana  7jungyoen   8mina  9chaeyong
Twice inspires me to become an idol if it is tough because they are doing what they love and I'm from America so after in done with high school I'm going to South Korea to pursue my dreams. ❤️   #LoveTwice #Once ❤️
this is d3finitely momos video! i love the others but momo here takes most of the spotlight!
I didn't even regret entering their fandom. Twice for the win 😘
How the HELL did they memorize this
2:45. 😭😭 why JYP? Wonder girls vibes. * cries internally
jeongyeon at 2:30 i see you girl
it feels like there is too small for TWICE...
Haters will say that Twice lipsync in this video:/
Momo u are my bias I swear but I can't stop staring at Jihyo
All this time i just notice jungyeon mistake at 2:30 😢
who's exols and onces here?
Dahyun scared me. She looked like she was gonna crack her head on the mirror

i love twice
i love this part 1:49
I like jihyo because she os cute and beautiful right?
I cant take my eyes off of nay she's seriously too pretty 💕
TZUYU iS SO CUTE ♥♥♥  SANA IS VERY BEATIFULL ♥♥♥♥♥  I like the energy of LISA OMG :O ♥♥♥♥♥♥  TWICE FIGHTING!!!! \u003e:v
Why is there a line on my he ground? Its never been there before!?!?!?
this song is so cachy
It's the same thing with all kpop music. All the flashy dances, flashy music videos, flashy pop voice. Don't get me wrong, they are talented and they sound good but it's so common to the point that almost all kpop music have the same element.
omg i really can't get my eyes off momo she's amazinngg!!
I really love Dahyun \u003c3 \u003c3 \u003c3
ONCE,please participate in mass streaming this weekend start from friday til sunday🙏
Tzuyu love youu😍😍
91k left for 1M subscriber.. please sub twice channel🙏
I like the sounds of shoes so much😹and their hair flip, damn, queens🔥Nayeon~a💞
Jihyo I love you
im just gonna be honest....they can't sing..their voice is just normal..just my honest thoughts i felt like spreading bcs people say 'twice is awesome!' this and that i don't see anything special
this is ugly
Is it safe to say that Nabongss is the center of twice?
Nabong is the face (image) of the group.
94k subs to go until 1M woohoo!!!
Twice is one of these groups where you cant focus on a single girl. I had to re-watch it 9 times. Worth it : )  However, Nayeon parts (ex. 2:25), she's kind of 'dying' here and looks like she's the only one that's pushing hips forward here : D
I enjoyed this more than the Official MV lol
jihyo sana tyuza? correct my spelling for her name
I just watched 2x speed of this and now it seems slow lmao
What is the name of the girl wearing a striped gray and white striped sweater in front at 2:35  (I discover twice)
thank you ^^
but look at twice TT dance practice video all of them are wearing pants and sana is not she was wearing shorts
Omg that outfit looks awesome in Chaeyoung 😍 😍 😍
i love you nayoun
I just noticed everytime they like rub their hairs their hairs gets messy exept for Mina 😂
i love you
Am I the only who loves what Chaeyoung is wearing cus DAMN!
Momo is on such a different level than everyone else. I know Mina is a classically trained dancer and she is super talented, but when it comes to jazz type choreography I think Sana is the closest one to Momo.
momo is such a great dancer OMG
oh my god im not even a twice stan but tzuyu is so adorable what the heck!!!
New to twice since I came from BTS and BP
Buddy here supporting twice!!    I wanted to say sorry for all the hate comments of my co buddy saying twice has no talent at all I'm so sorry (sorry for my bad english ^_^V)
twice good,they concer very good
I finally learned the dance :')
l love sana
jeongyeon is soooo white..well, all of them are soo white..hehehe
to be honest I don't really like twice songs but I really like this choreography and ooh ahh also
damn this choreo is difficult \u003c3 twice for pulling it off!!
How is Nayeon dancing with half of her shirt falling off! Magic, I tell you.
Chaeyoung' shoes and leather pants! Girl you're hot! 😱😌😘😍
I find sana looks like Pinkie Pie fro My Little Pony and i like that
solo puedo ver a momo es que baila tan bien y destaca frente a las demás, al menos de mi punto de vista Love you momo
have you noticed some of the dance moves are from the fire dance...just saying
This the hardest choreo of twice
Nayeon always slays me \u003c3 I love her sooo much she looked super cute and chill \u003ew\u003c
i think JYP is the best !!!!!
Okay so Blackpink broke twice and bts record for the most views in 24 hours no hate to blackpink but we are known as the streaming fandom, so when twice comeback, we have to show them all we got. once fighting!!! twice fighting!!!  Reply
I like both Blackpink and Twice! :) I think a lot of Twice's concepts are girly-ish concepts, while Blackpink have that slightly edgier side to their songs (at the moment, anyway haha). I'd love to see Twice comeback with an edgier concept, instead of a cute one! When Twice comes back again, I'm sure they'll do amazing! \u003c3
I watched with my kom and the whole time she was like ' Mira que bonitas'
jihyo is so pretty!!!! love her so much!!!!
once i feel like BP is going to break the record for most views in 24 hours. y'all better get ready to snatch that back on twices comeback.
Tzuyu stans are everywhere, but what about Jeongyeon? Where are her stans?
I love the girls outfit with the black leather pants grey shirt and short hair. I wannnnt it
no talent at all. only girl group that i hate. dance was so easy and dumb. blackpink has so much talent.
omayghad holy shet this dance is so bouncy and fats are bouncing loljk HAHSHAJAKAHAH
can JYP get them a bigger practice room though?^^'  I'm in love with this dance♡
chaeyoung looks better with longer hair
Jeongyeon as beautiful as ever    I have my pc and cell phone complete of your photos  -I love you
I think jihyo should be the visual
Twice the dancing queen. Lol snsd is also the dancing queen. ONCE and TWICE are rocking the girl group ~Btw iam an ARMY TOO.WHO is an ARMY and ONCE
I can get fatigue just by watching this video
Kyaaahh!! i love Tzuyu!! that's why im want to meet her in person!!! but my wish never will be😣😣
I can't do the second heart .-.
what do you guys think about Twice Signal dance? is it easy / hard / kinda normal ?
What is the fandom called? I think I might join it...um so yeahh
i love twice
Dahyun makes the dance look so freaking simple while Momo turning it into the most hardcore dance she can
for the new Twice fans (Once)    Jihyo: Black long straight hair with a white and long shirt.  Nayeon: Red hair and red lipstick.  Sana: Blue shirt with large trousers and long brown hair.  Chaeyoung: Short hair with skinny trousers and red lipstick.  Mina: Short black hair with a white t shirt.   Momo: White T shirt with black trousers and light brown hair.  Sana: shirt with straps and jeans.  Jungyeon: The only one wearing shorts.  Dahyun: Wavy blonde hair with white and yellow shirt.  ❤❤❤
We loved it so much. Sana is beautiful. And of course everyone
Wow. I took about 10 minutes to find out that it's Sana.
omg u can hear the footsteps lol
I can watch this all day.
Me rn: /wondering why my friends hate this cute girl group;
anyone know who the choreographer is??
ok but why are they all wearing such amazing gf looks?!!?!
Honestly the choreography is easy but believe me it is more than that, you sweat a lot if you do it right, until my legs hurt, I think I will leave in exercise for this
Are you coming to Eskişehir Turkey?
I laaaaaaaaav it girl!!! \u003c3
I would like to say congrats to TWICE and how hard they worked on this and their other songs. But I will say to the people that disliked both this and the mv. I dont see you guys putting in the effort or hard work dancing in such a large group. Or famous for the songs that you do. Thank you very much! 😊
I'm new to kpop someone help me
momo ı love you
I love you twice
They all just rely on his face alone, while their vocals are lacking
i dont like this song,,,
I'm Armonce.... I love both Bangtan and Twice... they're fantastic... Love ya Bangtwice.. 😍😍😍😍😍
i love you
Jeongyeon at 2:31 hahah. After all these times watching this multiple times, i just noticed that cute mistake.
Lets Don't tell Twice they are Perfect!
wow its twice is not talent she is fuck dance
It looks like BTS - Not Today moves. The choreography looks so powerful 😂. But I love it! Saranghaeyo TWICE! 😍😗😙😘😚
srsly, can't take my eyes off of momo ♥
they all look so good im in tears
Twice is my everthing
I love nayeon. CUTE RABBIT IS PRICESS NAYEON....
For anyone saying TWICE choreos are easy and TWICE has no talent.    1. SIGNAL choreo is harder than the other title songs they released, but the chorus has a pretty simple and straightforward dance, so everyone of most age can dance to.    2. TWICE is popular for their catchy tune and simple, easy dance.    Gfriend, on the other hand, is popular for their difficult choreography (no hate, i love them too)    Red velvet is kinda like TWICE. Although their choreos are harder than TWICE, their chorus dance is easy. (Rookie, with the hands alternating (up and down) Russian roulette, with the hands in front of the hips and beside head. (Also the gun gesture) Etc.    Each group has a signature dance moves/concept, so don't judge TWICE because of some other groups dances/concepts.
Girlie_ TheGamer who are you talking to?
Cindy.. please enlighten me on how out of the 10 comments including mine now.. you were the only one to misunderstand what Cloudy meant?    He/She specifically said that each group has signature dance moves and concepts and that you shouldn't compare Twice's dances to any other group's dances... he/she wasn't talking badly about Red Velvet in anyway.. and let's remember that what's easy or hard to you, might be different for other people, as the comments above have proven.
Signal choreo is hard because it doesn't have a strong tempo like it's music, its a different move every four beats. Somehow a challenge to master this choreo has begun in my school.
Is this really TWICE Or just a fan Account
For the new ONCEs:  Nayeon - Red hair, white shirt with the blue and white stripes shirt topped  Mina - white shirt, black pants, hair in shoulders  Dahyun - orange hair, that's it 😂  Jihyo - Black straight hair, blue pants,  Momo - dark red hair, black pants, white shirt  Jungyeon - white shirt, short shorts, black jacket  Chaeyoung - short hair, gray shirt  Sana - blondish hair, gray and black stripe shirt  Tzuyu - blue and gray sweatshirt    **for more accuracy**  In the last 'i must let you know' in the beginning, they are aligned in the order below  ( left to right )  Nayeon, Mina, Dahyun, Jihyo, Momo , Jungyeon, Chaeyoung, Sana, Tzuyu      *Welcome to the ONCE family! 💜*
Yuan Froilan i don't speak english but thanks v':
Yuan Froilan for dahyun(my bias wrecker)dayun has orange and white black pants and she has only *red shoes ok*
Incase anybody's confused  Yes, You can spell it either Jeongyeon or Jungyeon
Jihyo the bestttt!! She is always the naturally adorable oneeeeee❤️❤️❤️
who is the leader and assistant leader of twice?
happy birthday tzuyo/tzuio ummm I dont know the spelling besides I'm new -_-'
A best asmr k-pop song! XD I love the sound of their shoes
oh my gosh  Bias List:  1.Sana  2.Jihyo  3.Mina  4 Tzuyu  5.Nayeon  6.the blond girl i frogot the name of her
to all the once haters:   why did you call yourself a once if you dont appreciate their song. i mean they worked hard for this. √ so haters back off. just dont watch it if you dont like it 
well I thought the haters was called thrice.....
i love you
I love momo's outfit
The sound of the footwork at 0:56 is oddly satisfying lol.
we love you jihyo!!! 😘
this choreography is super cute tbh  and also they make it look so easy, when in reality i try it i cant even remember the moves and fall to the ground from all that exercise lmao
Momo needs to stop being a dance machine!! Its getting scaryyyyy. Dance line is damn scary lmao
Anyone feel like Lia Kim choreographed this?
this song is really addictive after listening several times.. and the dance is the best among all of their songs.. I focus on Momo, her body told that dance is her thing.. btw i'm not ONCE, i'm HOTTEST, but support JYP family!!
I came back just to hear the *'shoe tapping'*(this always plays in my head for some odd reason) and the *'clap'* during Sana's part (you can't hear it during live perf)!! 😂😍
Momo and Sana...  These girls will be the death of me.    Also about the argument about who's the best dancer after Momo, guys...  Please....There are different genres, different techniques and different styles that you can dance to/with. For me, I believe for example, Sana is better than Mina at some dances and moves and Mina is better than Sana at other dances and moves. You can't really judge when one is a specialist at a whole different style...Ballet.  For me, Mina is a little awkward, usually having no expression whatsoever  and idk about Sana, sometimes her moves aren't what they need to be. Like powerful and stuff like that.  But it varies according to the song, and please just appreciate their talent. Because both of them are good dancers.  Even though this song suits Momo the best *~*
i leve you 😘😘😘😍😍😍😍😍😉😉😉
I wonder why Dahyun has no FAN to support her on thid video? WHY? Bias:dahyunnie :)
I love twice
Dont care about who prettiest is. My ultimate bias are Jihyo & Jungyeon- beauty, talented and kind
2:30 Jeongyeon is so cute,When she did the wrong step😊 (Sorry for bad english)
niiicee dance choreography better then the otherse alot
2:31 I see you Yoo Jeongyeon 😂 I always follow your moves so stop being that cute
Who is the girl in the blue ripped jeans with the grey striped sweater shirt ?!
Who else notice the mistake of Jeongyeon at 2:30?
I'm about to say that also
onces vote to momo in TC candler https://www.instagram.com/tccandler/
ugh. theyre so fit and beautiful, while i am here eating a large bag of hot cheetos.
Am I the only one that noticed that during Jungyeon's first part at 0:45-0:46 Jihyo was a split second faster than the others?     Also, Jungyeon's mistake somewhere in 2:31 was so cute😍
how many years they have before they will disband?? I wish there is no limit
Tzuyu you're my bias but baby gurl WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?! 😂
omg i hate this song...... last yr i hated TT too, but the more i listen to it the more i like it, so this yr i gave this song a million try and i still can't put up with it, especially the part that says'  try to let u know blah blah(korean) signal blah blah(korean) (the parts in the song that's the same as 0:08) i really hate that part.
sana why are you sooo cute,,,i wish i can be you,,,,someday,,,,xD,,,,
I love that Jihyo is finally getting the recognition she deserves.  #GodJihyo
to once that attend to twiceland encore,please please please,show ur strong support through fanchant!scream as loud as u are!!! TWICE ONCE FIGHTING💪💪💪
Never try to do the signal dance on 2x speed
1:32 i saw you momo 👀
'Let's Put on Pants but Let's not Say Jeong Yeon' lol  And also this 'Let's all put on Black and White Slippers but Let's not Say Dahyun'
Twice in red lipstick is my new aesthetic
Oh my god ! Dahyun so cute 💕
At first, I didn't really like this song or choreography....But now..I'm obsessed with the choreography and song! These girls are amazing ^-^.
before i used to be like ''this song is too girly'' but now this song is my LIFE!
who else was having goosebumps while watching this
2:21 - 2:24 gave me anxiety for jeongyeon omg her head was so close to hitting the mirror 
their breath after its done😂
the shoes 'tap tap tap' sound is satisfying.....
I feel like Momo really enjoyed this dance she's just radiating like damn
damn i hate the filter its too white
is this dance mirrored?
Like, Momo is really good. The way she dance is on a whole other level. wow lol
Cute Jungyeon made a mistake at 2:31  Aww, I hope you don't get scolded for that.
mina's body are goals as as momo , jongeon i saw you at 2:30 hhh i saw u guiirl
I think Momo's dynamic dancing pushes the standard and the other girls are improving on their dance ... Yeay for all
Hey once(s) , who is who? Who's main dancer too? And who are the cutties in black pants and Grey shirt, blue flannel and black pants? 
Twice=Pretty   They are so preety.  oh♥
I. love you
2:30 Jeongyeon its not the dududu part I know u wish it was the end
Turn the speed into 1.5  it's much BETTER.
Sana could be a model for jeans
I'm new and I keep forgetting the girl in the front at 1:47
I've finally learned the dance twice fighting!!!!!!! signal bonae signal bonae
I love Jihyo's outfit
Subscribe to their channel PLEASE!!!
Jeongyeon made a mistake at 2:30 it was so cute🐶
they wear long pants except jeongyeon😂
i do not get why some people hates them. omg come on, no one should hate anyone if they didnt do something bad. thats just cruel. these girls? theyre precious. i mean, all those hatred they receive, all those bad comments they read or hear, i know it hurts them. but you guys know what, Twice still gives us ONCE their smiles and joy. they give us happiness more than we give them. trust me, im a fangirl. Mina is my bias. and please to haters, stop the hate because they didnt do anything bad. theyre just spreading joy and showing their talent. okay, if you say they dont have any talent, will JYP choose them. i mean come on look at their seniors. and if they dont have any talent at all, would you or can you sing and dance on a stage in front of millions of people? thats not easy. these girls are good. xD
Yes i know Once love Twice, but give them hates and bad cmts or what is Thrice's choice, don't stop them 😒😒
People are just salty that Twice is the no.1 k-pop group popularity wise. They'll get over it eventually and the dislikes/hate comments will slow down.
matthew yu my bias is Santa and tzuyu
That's why they are 'TWICE' they double the love we 'ONCE' give them :)

Jihyo finally is your time to shine     YOU GO GIRL!💙
I heard that jihyo had a knee injury so jihyo was not in twice i think for a week or 1 month?! Or almost 1 month idk
MAIRA DONEZAu she still doesnt get appreciation
actually she is the group leader sooo
tzuyu was my bias i
So many interesting formations can be made with 9 people
Who is the girl at the middle at 1:46
mabel pines It's dahyun 😊 The one who signs her hand a heart 😊👍
Lovely Mhae Abalos no the blonde one
the girl short hair ? its chaeyoung
Jungyeom always different from the rest 😂😂 everyone wearing like jeans while she.... My legs are to beautiful to be covered 😂😂😂
To think I used to listen to American music❤️💖
Idk why but I just danced to this in 6 inch heels....... I NEED MEDICAL ATTENTION! \u003c3
I really liked Ooh Ahh and TT was okay, but the dance to signal just seems so...random and senseless. To me, the song didn't even fit a particular choreography, and this one was literally all over the place - like someone was forcing them to not stop dancing and using all these random moves lol.
0:40 dance look similar for BTS run
The sound of their shoes tapping the floor is oddly satisfying
I think its a bit unfair to say that some members are better than others, I love all of them! Your group is a breath of fresh air in K-POP industry. Love from Russia~~~
Who else noticed Jihyo's wink at the last part? Ahoho
i realy wanna go to your meet and greets but i cant i live in the philipiens i cant speak korean i cant understand korean im not korean my parents dont allow me to go and k have no ticket or pass or something like that

jihyo is  more beautiful than before
I hate Twice
Jeongyeon!! I know sometimes u stand on back front but remember your fans are always watching u❤
For a minute I was thinking that Dahyun is going to walk right into the mirror at 0:30
I love twice forever
BTS has its Golden Maknae Jungkook  Gfriend has Its Golden Member Yuju  Got7 Jinyoung can also be a Golden Member  And twice has Its Golden Leader Jihyo, LEADER-NIM once are really proud of you 🤗 please stay healthy 🤗    btw, Sana-chan really fits in this kind of concept, TWICE Fighting 😇😍😀🤗
lol came here to dislike but saw i already did.why are they even popular...i have seen better girl groups tbh.
is anyone there having difficulties dancing to tzuyu's part XD that jump step jumstep tsirit tsirit
they are all perfect
my reaction after that *BANG* on the floor at the last part : OUCH 🙈🙊
Incredible as always. Bunch of talented,pretty and adorable girls. love ya,TWICE!
I have a genuine question about Sana's dance at 0:20 in general - she turns around for the first time at this timestamp then turn back then turn around again.  Is this intentional?  The first time I saw it I thought it was intentional but then she does it even in the dance video so maybe she's meant to turn around twice while the other members turn around just once at the beginning?
Pretty impressive that Tzuyu and Sana get the hook...
Anyone else think that this choreo is more difficult then their previous songs?
How tall is Sana? She looks  kinda tall here, or at least she does to me...😌
Jihyo I am happy for you seriously I am crying for you you are shining like the most beautiful star in the world
i really love how MOMO is dancing.......
jeongyeon's legs are brighter than my future 🙈
haha i understand what you said Nick Dang (i study chinese)
They failed to sell out the tickets for their concert at Jamsil Olympic Stadium right?
?? why do we need an article? you better check Interpark now which is official ticket distributor. You cannot purchase the tickets of TWICE's encore concert in Jamsil except from scalpers only.
It's not. There are no articles about it.
I've been recently into this group.These girls are amazing! 😁😁😁Can someone please tell me their names and outfits?
Sorry for late reply😂    White shirt with yellow sleves, red shoes and Orange hair = Dahyun✨    Grey T-shirt and Black 'leather' pants, short hair = Chaeyoung🦄    White Long sleeved shirt, blue jeans and long Black hair = Jihyo🌸    White shirt with cardigan over, shorts and pretty short silver-ish hair = Jungyeon💍    Blue and White cardigan, White shoes and pink hair = Nayeon🐰    Grey and Black long sleeved shirt, blue jeans, and Caramel Brown hair = Sana💞    White T-Shirt, black (grey-ish pants) and auburn hair = Momo💄    White T-shirt, Black pants, medium length Black hair = Mina🌈    Long sleeved blue and Grey shirt, Black pants, and Brown hair = Tzuyu💋
Omo😍😍I really love twice😍😍they are awesome😍
Erin McGuirk   lol choreo is not about easy or difficult ..but about suitable with the song 😊 like WG 'nobody' or SNSD 'gee' , not hard but so good ;)
kiri __BTS__ I learned it it's not that hard
queen Liem Your right :) I love how all of the steps match with the music too
kiri __BTS__   actually choreo is not about easy or difficult, for me the important is the dance suitable with the song, thats why i love kpop, and for me this is great choreo, not about difficult or easy but this choreo is so catchy and make u love this song more and more :) #opinion
I'm a bit confused. On Weekly Idol, Momo kneeled instead of Nayeon at 1:30? Did they switched the kneeling part for the 2x speed Signal?
I can watch it 3 times a day or more, cause Dahyun, Momo and Tzuyu kills me with this. Cause Dahyun's eyesmile is like Tiffany, Tzuyu is like Yoona and Momo is like Hyoyeon when dancing.
Ceren Moray I'm not comparing TWICE to SNSD I'm just saying that they're similar (a little). I'm a TWICESHIDAE shipper !!
I watch many groups... and as old as what I said was, its still true. Im not even hating on twice at all, I just need to clear up the idea of twice being the 'next snsd'. because theyre so different.
Yes they are good... but incomparable to SNSD. Please don't. If you really want, watch SNSD debut MR removed before comparing
But they are not like anyone else.. They are TWICE  stop comparing them with GG please
What is the name of the blond girl in the middle @1:40  TIA
Tnx, im new to TWICE!. but i i know all of them now :)
Jeongyeon just caused my death. I'm so gay for her. Like... Her voice, her visuals, her amazing personnality, I can't resist 😍
Like who isn't gay for Jeongyeon?
2:31 i see you *JeongYeon* 
For me this is by far the hardest dance they danced😂😍
who is the girl in the grey shirt and navy ripped jeans with the vans? her dancing is awesome
Nayeon's outfit is so big on her and looks so cute I'm dying I love it
im not momo biases but shes really the main dancer!
waiting for a jungkook version of this
Jenny Potter OH MY GOD! Who would ever call Jihyo fat? She has one of the best figures out of the group! Sh's one of the prettiest girls too. I can't believe they would call her fat. She's perfect as she is 💞💞
1:44 daehyun's cute little heart dance as she crouches 😍😍
It happened again. I didn't  like this song at first but now ı am always listening just like cheer up
So I have been into Twice for a long while but I have never tried to learn their names and tried to let it come naturally but I only know a few, any help? (: Theyre amazing and whenever I see them I cry I dont know why. Hope im not the only one.
DON'T LET MOMO BE HUNGRY thank you (:
1.33 nayeon unnie lost balance....yet still looks amazing. Jihyo is truly gajihyo. being able to learn this choreography with an injury is amazing.  momo - dancing mochine
I love the sound when there shoes it the ground at the same time
loving chae's leather pants
amazing
who like twice🙈🙈
Really love this choreo 😍😍
can someone tell me who's who ? please :( I'm really lost
YOU GUYS HAVE TO TRY LEARNING THIS DANCE!!! It's really simple once you learn the steps. I learned how to do this dance in under a day! Of course I still need to practice it, but at least I know the steps and how to put them together 😇 try learning the steps and I promise you, that you won't regret trying. This is actually an easy dance! Try it 😍      Btw I'm not at all any form or way an experienced dancer 😂 That goes to prove that you can do it if I can.
You can tell that Momo is like 'Thank god I get to let loose with this choreography'
ILove  you twise
Sana is so perfect here. I don't care what people says, I'm proud of her and that she's my female ultimate bias. 사랑해요 언니
Is Jeongyeon supposed to make a heart at the end? 3:23
Tzuyu outfit is my favorite it's so comfy looking and she makes it look good because she so tall.     Mina my darling dancing gracefully don't need to try hard. love her so much.
Im not really familiar with this group as i left kpop years ago, now im back to stan Day6. and recently i got into this group.    As a dancer, i'd love to say i really love 3 members here.  the one who wears white shirt with sweatpants, her moves are clean, sharp and powerful, she has her own aura.cant take my eyes off.   the one who stands in the middle at 1:32, she dances really well with clean moves  and the one who wear white shirt with ripped jeans. her moves are smooth and so fluid, she is pretty too.  anyway, im officially a fan because of those three. I'm gonna learn their names. Twice, jjang!!
TheIlovess501 The one wearing sweatpants is Momo, the girl in the jeans and grey sweater is Sana and the girl with the ripped jeans is Mina (My bias) I think they are all the main dancers of the group, so you spot good dancers well! I hope this helped you!
+Azri Fitria Jeongyeon is the one wearing shorts..
My bias wrecker Momo shines here. And I love Tzuyu's part my bias 💕
Watch my cover on Signal on my channel.. 😊😊.. hope u like it n subscribe to my channel.. ❤
I love mina
Wikihow: how to clap your Hands  Twice:1:35
is there an aircon there in the TWICE practice room?
Shy Blue Crystal yea, its in the frame , look at the ceiling :))
Finally my bias Jihyo get some attentions now.. She's so beautiful and momo too...Momo's dancing skills is no Joke  But sometimes I notice Jihyo looks like Tzuyu...  Finally I memorize now their steppings and I know in every new songs their steppings will be improve in their dances too...
twice twice I love them so much like 1234231$$$$
MY DAHYUNNIE is sooo bright like litterally i cant see her but thats the lighting rightt
i love seeing them in regular clothes
I don't log in to my YT a lot, BUT GAWD DAMN THIS DANCE IS SO CUTE. My fav is Nayeon but they're all so adorable.
I might become a new twice fan because im honestly soo impressed with their dancing, I know some girl groups only go for the cutesy stuff but theyre cute AND their moves are complicated
chaeyoung in tight leather pants got me feeling some kinda way
Jihyo's so cute with white sweater... oh my god**
this dance practise is so cool... ^^
finally their dances get difficult
nayeon is my bias but i can't stop staring at jihyo !!
Cant anyone give them a bigger room come on they're super famous already they deserve practice room with bigger size and most importantly proper floor 
This video explains why MOMO is the main dancer of the TWICE
I love Jihyo so much ！She is my fav from all！She rocks！！！！！😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍❤❤❤❤❤💖💖💖💖💖💖💝💝💝💝💝
everybody 'sigh' soooo loong at the end, how pity😢
I love nayon ^_^
I love jihyo

Hannah Mendoza wassup my fellow army's/once!

I want to dance solo of tzuyu
i don't see any comments abt dahyun :\u003c my baby's so underrated, she needs more sarang. 💖 fighting squishy dubu!
James Esperat lol hahahaha i don't think so, she was already born with white skin hahahaha
Dahyun is so so cute.  Did she use too much kojic? lol
Am I the only one who notice that jeonghyun make a mistake at 2:31 but she cover it quickly so we can't see it properly😂😂      [EDITED]  *Jeongyeon  lol idk how to spell her name even though she is my bias😂😂 my mistake😂
2:31 I think i;m only the one who saw the wrong step of Jeongyeon but anyway Jeongyeon is num. 1 in my hearteu. Hihi
Nayeon is my love \u003c3
It's  hard to  follow the finger part
jihyo love u😘😘😘
Who is who?
Momo suits this choreo so much
Mina,You are so cute.I love you.
i enjoyed this more than their perf yesterday tbh
I'm wasn't a fan but I noticed they did so well I became a fan now hahaha
Trying to let you know~
wow it even passed knock knock dance version
My eyes are on Momo😍
i love TWICE so much it hurts T^T
Nobody comment about my bias, Mina..😞😭    She also good and beautiful in this dance practice. But many of them keep talking about Jihyo, Momo, Dahyun and Tzuyu.😞    Where's Mina's fans??😭
10m views less than a week for dance practice #TwiceIsYoutubeMonster
Am I the only one who loves watching Momo on 1:59?  Like it's such a simple part but she's so into it!
Can someone help me tell them apart
Jeongyeon is the 2rd best dancer
twice come to brazil and me come please
Momo shines here!. i really love the J-trinity line! 💓💓#Signal
am I the only one who thinks that chaeyoung's outfit is so sexy? not to mention her red lips
jeongyeonnie's mistake during 2:30 is funny and adorable at the same time 😊😊😊😊😀😀😀😀
Every time I watched Korean group dance practice, I am really curious how they learned the position movement and how come they can move so perfectly?    #LOVETWICE
Sometimes i want to try XD
Where are the comments about my baby Dahyun? She's so cute! :3
the only sound that was obvious is chaeyoung's footsteps 😂
Not lying I actually come here for many times because I'm learning their dance haha. It's addicting.
TWICE was my favourite girl group of KPOP :) !!!
Are they wearing wooden clogs??? Lmao
Chaeyoung looks really beautiful with that outfit
ijyp make the twice dance sexy
I like the jungyeong's and chaeyoung's part. Their dance steps are so amazing! but hard
Twice Choreographies (Title Tracks)  1. Like Ooh-Ahh (dnace break still kills it)  2. Signal  3. Do it again  4. Knock Knock  5. Cheer Up  6. TT
2:30 oops nobody saw that jeongyeon... hahaha
Jongyeons hair looks so pretty on her I want to see how she looks with long hair 💖💓😘      Edit:sorry i meant jungyeon I can't spell haha 😂 don't hate plz
All the comments are about Jihyo and Momo and their pretty much my biases but I have to give it to Tzuyu who gave chills when she said jidi jidi ~
I love this song and this dance omg
I love Jihyo
WTF with the intro? :v
Jihyo is very  outstanding in this era.
Did anyone notice how Jeongyeom made a mistake at 2:30? Hihi its very freaking cute! \u003c3
does anyone know what kind of shoes the white low tops are?
is it just me or... I noticed Jeongyeon made a mistake in 2:29-2:30😂 kyeopta :'))
can someone tell me who is who? :') Im an army and Twice got me here :')
Wakana San   white top with yellow and red sneakers is dahyun  One with short hair, black leather pants and grey top is chaeyoung   Blue jeans and white sweater is jihyo (leader)  Black pants with grop white top is Momo  Black pants with white t shirt and black hair is Mina  Blue and white flannel is Nayeon  Blue jeans and grey sweater is Sana  Dark blue sweater with light blue on the sides and the tallest is Tzuyu (maknae)  One wearing shorts is jeongyeon
so now everyones saying that jihyo is so pretty. like you guys never said it that much until she 'changed'.
krys yeah I noticed that just cause she changed her hair colour everyone now thinks she is beautiful. It's actually sad. I think she is pretty no matter what
the only choreography im willing to dance to is when jungyeon sings
1:51 'Hapiness! Annyeonghaseyo Red Velvet ibnida!!!' -sorry I had to..-
im focusing at jungyeon hair and waiting it to get long
The problem of JYP is shoes sound in the dance.
Does the chorus to this song remind anyone else to the chorus of gee? Kinda for just how cute and catchy it is. Like I know all twice songs are like that but this kinda more than others to me.
Finally Jihyo gets more attention than the past haha
They are so cute my gay ass can't take this much adorableness!!😭😂
to be honest im dont like twice but i cant stop myself not to like mina
Set the speed to 1.5
Actually, change it to 2
I wanna learn the dance now...
every kpop group *-Maknaes-* are always sooo tall ;-;
i love u all
This is momo's era cause she makes this dance look so good! But twice fighting 💞
What shampoo do they use? Their hair is perfect after that hair flip at 0:39 and when I tried it, I look like a witch that came out from a box. SOMEONE TELL ME.
Damn this looks hard 😂
Actually I just tried it and I got most of it down 😂😂
I have just finally succumbed to this song that I hated so much. Not calling myself a once yet, but I liked their other songs until know, and I just couldn't bear that 'sign-signal' parts. JYP witty and cleverly assigned it to Momo and Mina, so that we would grow to like it. JYP, you sneaky bastard.
nayeon love YOU 😘😘
I start like them because of this song 😅
Omg Sana is so wife material like she can be cute,beautiful and hot at the same time but that doesn't mean anything to me because I'm a girl I'm just so jealous she is so pretty HAHAHA
Tzuyu wears so beauful in the dance.😍😍
Hearing their footsteps is satisfying to me because it's all in sync 😍
I really like tzuyus shirt!!! And she did a great job at dancing
I really really like Momo ❤😊 She's my wife now :p
Girls fight over who is the best in the group.....I just wanna take em all out on a date. Im hot, come om twice just date me.
i tryyyy to focus on the others but I seriously can't take my eyes off Momo! She continues to slay as well as the others!
Lol Jungyeon is the only one in shorts    Also, Tzuyu is not my bias but she's really underrated as a dancer.
haha who noticed Nayeon's lazy head bob at 2:35? \u003e.\u003c
One day......they will be hit by the mirror because of that dance....hhahahahha😂😂😂😂....just kidding...they are awesome but jihyo is more than awesome....like to who are jihyo stans here
When I saw the comments which kept talking about jihyo, I thought it was the jihyo from running man 🤣  No offense if you actually got offended
At 2:21, Jeongyeon is doing it so hard I fear that she's going to bang her head on the mirror.
Momo slayed my whole life during 0:44 ~  1:02. I JUST CANT KEEP MY EYES OFF OF HER.
I'm not a fan, but Jihyo is definitely so  perfect, I see all their choreographys only for  her 😍😍😍
I really love Momo's confidence when she dances and not to mention how much they look good in ordinary clothes😍True Goddesses😍
I did not much like Twice's previous songs and everyone says that Signal is the worst but why am I enjoying it? I mean I think i grown to like this song, really. HAHA
Can we just talk about how cute Daehyun is here for a sec
1) Tzuyu's voice in this song is everything   2) This is Jihyo's era (every twice era is Jihyo's era but she's getting more recognition. queen of visuals)  3) Signal \u003e Knock Knock
you are perfectly true!
ONCE here  VOTE 1000 kisses to TWICE 😘😘😘😘
Momo dances so much better she's making the other girls look bad lmao
Mina looks stunning in just about every video. That combined with her angelic voice makes her my first celeb/idol crush.
1:22 to 1:36 is one of my favorite choreography and it's pretty catchy. ❤️😂
this is now officially the most viewed kpop dance practice video of 2017
PanizJYP Stop feeling so threatened by other groups. You're the kind of person that ruins fandoms
my eyes was focused to Jihyo.
Am I the only one who *REALLY* likes Nayeons 'Daehallae'? 
Tzuyu looks soooo cute at the beginning.
nayeon was so sexy with her jackettt
Am I the only one notice that Momo and Sana scratching their head more than other members?
i love BTS
i cant wait to bts react to twice signal example in sma or gca 😍😘
Okay you know guys that lots of them shine !!  But no one was talking about **** **          anybody think Mina Slay cause i definitely say that she slayed!!
I’m so busy this past few days that I wasn’t able to watch the MV at the very moment that it was uploaded, so I was so curious when everyone in my timeline was ranting how disappointed they are with the song, and how other K-Pop fans said that it just became a hit again because it’s from Twice, since we all know that Twice is very popular now, that everything they do or release will be really a big hit. I personally watched the dance practice first before the MV, because I am not really a fan of music videos. Hahaha! I always prefer the dance practice version, but anyway, when I first listen to Signal, I am not disappointed at all, because it’s so bouncy it’s so upbeat, it’s a very enjoyable song actually. The choreography is so awesoooooooome too. It would make you feel like you actually want to dance with them. Hahaha! And in all fairness, I agree with everyone saying that this is their hardest choreography so far, I thought Knock Knock is the most complicated already, but then Signal came. Hahaha! I also want to thank JYP for giving Momo more center time for this come back, and more lines even though she’s singing the same part, but well, at least she’s singing it more than one time. I was so sad during their Knock Knock promotions because I can barely see Momo at the center But at least JYP didn’t disappoint me for this comeback^^  I also agree with some Once saying that this choreography was supposed to be cute, but seeing Momo’s sharp moves, my gooooosh it turned out to be a super awesome, cool, fantastic, marvelous, excellent, spectacular, stunning and brilliant choreography!❤ I just love Momo so much❤ I admit that Twice already debuted when I watched Sixteen, because I got curious with all the articles about Momo, saying that she was suddenly in the lineup even if she was already eliminated, so I was so curious on what Momo’s ability are for her to be able to debut with Twice even with the fact that she’s already eliminated, so I watched all the episodes of Sixteen, and I was also expecting for Somi to debut, because you know she’s always in the major group, but then it’s still JYP’s decision, and he knows what is best for Somi^^ Going back to Momo, when she was eliminated, my heart was broken even though I already know that she debuted with Twice, because the Japanese line’s (Momo,Sana,Mina) goal is to debut together in one group,then suddenly Momo was eliminated. But goooosh remembering that moment when Momo was at the audience side and suddenly she was called as the 9th member of Twice, goooooooosh, it still give me goosebumps! You know I think at that moment Momo was so happy and proud for Sana and Mina since they are already debuting, but of course there’s this little part in Momo’s heart whispering that “I should’ve been there too”, but with Momo’s hardwork, she got chosen by the staffs as the most hardworking trainee❤ Until now, we can see that Momo is still very hard working^^ Look how happy she is when she’s dancing, I really want to thank JYP for giving Momo a chance to debut with Twice, like I just can’t imagine if this talent will be fermented again in the training room, this kind of talent should be exposed in the whole universe❤ Time flies so fast, it’s almost three years already, Twice is gaining so much popularity now, I just also want to congratulate JYP for gaining back all the investments she made on Twice, I feel like Twice already paid everything in just one year. Hahaha! I also love their hairstyle for this comeback, like everyone really became prettier❤ I thought Momo was the prettiest during her blonde + thick bangs era in Ooh Ahh, but then she changed it to brownish + fringes in Cheer Up, then almost the same hairstyle during TT it’s just that her hair got longer. But then now, she’s so preeeeetty with a semi dark short hair, with fringes, goooooosh❤ Or it’s just that she’s really pretty in my eyes no matter what❤ She’s so fantastic❤ I just can’t mention our leader Jihyo here, black long hair + fringes suits her so much, she’s such a hottie❤ Jungyeon became prettier too, please let her hair grow longer❤ Chaeyoung suits short hair, it’s just that she didn’t inform JYP with her decision of cutting her hair. Hahaha! I hope they’ll try something crazier and unique hair color for Mina and Tzuyu, since they are always on the darker side of hairstyles in every comeback. I also miss Dahyun’s hair, like half black half blue. Hahaha! The rainbow hair color during Ooh Ahh❤ Or what if they try it on their next comeback that all members has the same hairstyle and hair color. Hahaha! Wouldn’t that be so asdfghjkl. Hahaha! TWICE fighting!❤ Momo fighting! ❤ Once fighting!❤ Thrice keep trying! Hahaha!
I love twice very much
as I watched I hold in my heart I can not stop the beat of my heart♥ im falling inloved him so much Saranghae MOMO ♥♥♥

they are 3 mistakes here .. did u notice guys?
I love the dance.. i just think i like it the most out of all twice's dances.. idk why but there's just something to this dance that makes it awesome
Momo's dancing was really awesome 💕👏🏻
Anyone else notice the couch is gone?
What the heck? Signal dance practice reached the views of Knock Knock's dance practice?! Well, I also prefer the dance here. Cute and a little bit hard.
how can jihyo learn this dance step a week bfore their comeback😱😱😱???truly a hardworking leader she is!!!rise JIHYO!!!
i liked the korean version more that the japanese version it s so strong
GALAXY DA BAE actually, we're amazed she learnt it in a week whilst recovering from a knee injury can we not praise our faves?
I'm new to twice and I have watched all of their m/v's and I LOVE their songs! could someone tell me who's who?
the fact that they probably won't do this concept EVER AGAIN because of the amount of dislikes *BREAKS MY HEART*
Don't tell jungyeon to wear leggings 😂  Don't tell Sana and Jihyo to wear black leggings😂
I really liked the footsteps 🤗🤗
Don't forget to keep streaming like ooh ahh and cheer up onces #roadto200million #fighting
Lets all wear pants and dont tell jeongyeon    jeongyeon's legs blend the wall tho
I cant choose my bias T.T
had to listen to this song more than once. now I'm obsessed with it😍 the choreography is so in sync and cute I love it💕💕
Why do I feel like the light is so bright ? Lol. The brightness..😂 compared to other dance practice videos..
Why Twice new song always stuck in my head? I'm not a fan of Twice,I just listened to their new song when it is out..and the chorus part always stuck in my head for a very long time....... I still don't know who is who like tbh lol. I only know who is jeongyeon LOLLL because I only followed her fanpage on ig 😂
i love nayeon...so cute
2:31 Jeongyeon mistake but she still cute \u003c3
this is the best choreography i've seen from twice yet, im proud of how much they've improved!
I love you so much♥
DAHYUN and JEONGYEON my babies
I feel like the song and the choreo are childish but they're cute so yeah
i love jihyo and nayeon part ❤️❤️😻😻 slay
momo's stan where are you at?😍
whos the one in the middle at 0:35?
can someone tell me whos loud ass clap that was as 1:35 ??? that scared  me
i have a feeling that i can do this dance
I think this dance is more difficult than before.
Jungyeon do another part at 2:31
MOMO is so powerful .. i love her!!
does anyone know where I can find the exact same long sleeve that Sana is wearing??
aaa help which ones are jihyo and momo??
Ercocal 17 ah thanks you so much! I was really looking for Momo's name :)
Lorelay Jackson   Jihyo= Long black hair & blue jeans  Momo= Brownish hair, white shirt, & black pans(the one that dances so powerfully & stands out the most in video)
sorry for being dumb, but who's the one dancing like crazy with a white tshirt, black sweat pants and long dark hair again?
why it's uploaded when jeongyeon forget the choreo and mina has a little bit late at jihyo's part? it doesn't perfect anymore:(  i'm disappointed:(
I am so in love with their style how do you look hot while doing such a cute dance
lol 0:21 hahaha dahyun sent a signal(tzuyu) while travelling and got to sana it buffered and reloaded before the signal got to chaeyoung XD
who's who?
That hushing end (and ofc footsteps) tho, eargasmic, they really put an effort to this.
their dance are more improved!
i'm not twice stans. but i heard there is so many hate on this song..so i came here and the music video. Why they hate it? This song is nice..
realist I know that too,it's true. i afraid of their future. Quality is more important because popularity is temporary. i think they are talented, but jyp make a bad choices to do this concept. Beauty,popularity,fame, is only an temporary image. The real one that can survive is only the talents and good personality.
i mean, it doesn't have a new beat, it's like they're speaking, no good vocals other than maybe jihyo, but it's not bad. just nothing notable or blockbuster worthy.     anything will be catchy if you listen to it a few times imo
I love this song💕😭
Mimo makes my harty harty crazy

Momo is seriously dancing machine. She rocks every song. This choreography seems very hard T.T the song is cute.
im so going to try and learn it :)
stop being so cute girls. try to do a bad girl concept sometimes.
stop being so cute girls. try to be a bad girl sometimes.
That's Twice. I'm so proud of them😏
They finally remove that big black couch on the corner :)) Go Momo! :) \u003c3

You call this music?
omg!!!! Dahyun í so beautiful, I love twice so much ^_^
Jungyeon almost do another part after cirit part tzuyu
I always worry about the corner dancers like pls dont hit yourself on the mirror or wall
I don't care what they say, I just love them. If you hate them just leave them alone and let ONCE enjoy.
all the time i thought that jeongyeon don't have legs😂 hahaha
Jeongyeon legs are so pretty than me.   *cries*
I love Sana's outfit, lol i'm so random.
they are so beautiful and dance well
I love jihyo
TWICE sending their love to ONCE
Am I the only one who got scared by the claps?  😂
Omg they're like dancing sticks. Look at their legs, straight af. Anw they're cute tho
who is that girl in white t-shirt and black pants with bangs
Wonderful Once  thank you. i like the she dance i love it. though i'm not a twice fan i like her😊
2:40 I love that sound
mina look so pretty with black hair 😍😍😍
Sana's so cute I was twice before and from the start sana caught my attention
ARMY supporting I love how the dance came up its so cute and I love the Song 😍😙
momo slaying as always \u003c3
What is the name of the girl in grey t-shirt? She's cute.
how can jihyo learn this dance step a week bfore their comeback😱😱😱???truly a hardworking leader she is!!!rise JIHYO!!!
sana and tzuyu you are a good dance.
sana and tzuyu you are a good dance.
I love them
Love them!!!!!!😍😍😍😍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
for all the haters you know that you are just making twice more popular right
Jihyo looks amazing 😍
Hey guys! I did a dance cover of this song. It was really fun! I would appreciate it if you checked it out~ Twice FIGHTING!
who notice JeongHyeon's mistake? 2:30
In the minute 0:08 to 0:24 is similar to the choreography of bts {21st century girls}
-Momo ♥ you always distracting my concentrate for Jeongyeon -_- ☺♥  But im still #TeamJeongyeon ♥☺♥☺
Is it me the only one who love Jihyo's hair this comeback? *(Straight and Black)*
the best intro ever  beside exo's tree
This choreography has a strong feel to it. It's cute but powerful. Great combination tbh! Loving the comeback 💗💗💗
I CAN'T BELIEVE TWICE NEEDED THE 4TH MINI ALBUM TO YOU ALL SEE THAT JIHYO IS PRETTY     (sorry for my bad english :x)
they really try hard in a regular song
twice I love uujj lol
the front girl at 1.02 is that Jihyo or tzuyu?
The song is beautiful with me
am i the ply one that think that Jeongyeon looks flawless in this comeback?!
This choreography is more difficult than the previous comeback like Knock Knock and TT. As example, TT is easy to dance because it not difficult and can learn quickly. But, SIGNAL has many dancing part and its beat is very fast.  (My ENGLISH SKILL was not EXCELLENT so don't be care if I has some fault 😅😂)
im totally worried in this video..i know jihyo was recovered..but in this video look her legs unstable...How she manage herself while preparing for this comeback? im proud of you jihyo~
Everyones catching my sight😍
I think there starting to like mature now.... 😌😏 these queens slay tho....
Jihyo looks amazing with dark hair!!!!!!!!
the girls really look amazing, look great and look pretty. tzuyu and momo unnie love you 😊
ahem...                  please appreciate jungyeon.   thanks for listening
Who made the choreography?
2:06  It kinda looked like Mina forgot! I love her even more 😂
why Not dance practice to touchdown please
I'm new who's the one with the yellow sleeves and red converse 😍
JD79 Hekhek47 thanks😊
OMG Chae you're so cute ❤ Twice always talented and amazing. I love the song
I love you   Twice
never ending love for my bb tzuyu
😮😮😮😮 there really good
this song is actually cute ;-;;
Am I the only one who saw the cute mistake of Jeongyeon at 2:30?
that makes her cute :)
Angela Jung I think she is very cute with her mistake. We always love her. We always love her with her mistakes. AWW SO CUTE \u003c3 \u003c3
i like this more than TT and cheer up dance, twice more better👍 momo dance👏
I love Jeong-yeon the most, am I the only one?
20m for this
Momo is the main dancer not because she's good at dancing but because she's constantly improving. She has her own dancing style. Sometimes it's satisfyingly sharp, sometimes swift and graceful. However, I'm always satisfied by her dancing it brings me so much joy tbh I can't wait to see more.
am I the only one who watches it at least 11 times each time? 1 as a whole then 9 times focusing on each member and then another time as a whole \u003c3 hehe
the on my way to school move (nayeon part) looks a bit more aggressive here
Happy Birthday to Kim Dahyun 😍 #DahyunDay
does anyone think that the action at 1:58 is familiar?
this is soooooooooooooooo AWESome!!!!!!
i love watching dance video because i can see their casual outfit:)
Never thought I would fall in love with 9 girls at the same time.
They seem a lot more synchronized this time around! I'm impressed!   Momo stands out so much! Dancing machine indeed! And Jihyo, I feel so proud for her, finally shining! ♥️
wow its so amazing
Twice the Dance break, View and Aegyo Queens
Chaeng, I love u sm 😍😍😍
please do comeback to hell
IM NAYEONNIEEEE Omg how can someone be so beautiful \u003c3
I literally can't stop staring at her thru the whole vid lol
Jeongyeon why so pretteu pretteu?!
NGL I love sana's legs...
i've been seeing many Jihyo comments - I completely agree.      SHE'S SO PERFECT ASDFGHJKL; WHYTRHWYHYW      But Jeongyeon is looking so freaking adorable with her outfit- i- \u003c3
Omg i had the same thoughts too
Who told Tzuyu to where to high water pants 😂😂 still cute tho
everyone talking about how *insert* member is slaying and i can't even tell them apart 💀
jihyo is my idol and iwnt to meet him
i can't believe it that twice are have talent♥♥
i love you twice
Momo is in another level !
so many unliker Busher's hey if you don't like the video don't comment bullshit you idiot your not kpop lovers duhhh crazy
I almost got this dance
Dhayun has my style😍😍😍
Jihyo is unmatched both in beauty and voice...my heart really beats like anything upon seeing her... she's the epitome of beauty.
im glad they're improving A LOT.
I realized that the members are starting to mature just by looking their choreo💖
Tzuyu so beautiful,nayeon is also beautiful in her style this time,jihyo really skinny than before
so I'm like 98% sure they're not actually saying titty, but what are they saying?
Wow I've watched their performances so many times but I only just realised they put the FOREIGN LINE in front for the ending formation at 3:19 HAHA
Me: *watches video 9 times to focus on each member*  Also me: *I cAn'T fOcUs On EaCh MeMbEr WiTh MoMo ThErE*
Tzuyu is the best \u003c3
Stephanie Atienza lol.. its not even the same.. and even that song copying someone else work.. stop being so dramatic
I love the choreo!!
I'm so proud of the dance line Momo Tzuyu Mina💕
Twice love ♡.♡
woaaaaw, I love this choreo soooo much! especially 'jirit jirit' part XD ♡
Sana at the begining   Okay this is my turn   Ow i forgot to bring the heart  😂😂😂
*Played in 1.25 Speed*  wow it looks so normal   *Played in Normal Speed*  is this the normal one or 0.75 speed?
Look at Jungyeon at 2:30. Haha😂😂. Btw, Jihyo is so pretty and her voice is amazing...
I don't like the way Momo dance she's so energetic. I prefer Nayeon hehe no hate okay?
chaeyoungs legs are so beautiful im crying
Jihyo is a natural beauty, she the most preety😍😍😍😍😍😍
i hope in their next comeback they'd have a powerful dance because momo can do better than this. just look at how she sLAYS AAAAA
Jeongyeon's body movements are actually impressive. She's a lot better of a dancer than I realized
I need a comeback with Chaeyoung's kind of outfit and another with Nayeon's kind of outfit 😍😍😍😍😍
am i the only person who's looking at sana being sassy? mina is forever bae but sana's smile is contagious
momo i love you
guys it fucken took you tWO YEARS TO REALIZE JIHYO IS PRETTY, MOMO SLAYS AT DANCING AND TZUYU IS YOUR BIAS NOW DAFOOQ
Sana's body is amazing
I absolutely love Jungyeon. She's such a good dancer and stands out a lot to me. Her moves seem really sassy while some of the others make it seem more cute and it's all just wonderful.
i watched momo the whole time and i must say she is so so good at everything she does omg
who is in the red converse? bc shes my bias now
Their dance skills are so on point like you can't pick out a weak link! ;O
Jihyo's moment at 2:07 sends shivers down my spine every time I watch it. What a goddess.
this is most def my favorite choreography from twice, im impressed
Momo in 1:17 - 1:21 like me when someone buys me food 
I love TWICE!!
i love this song now , frankly speaking , i hated this song  first time i heard it .
I am just in this world bcos of jihyo...seeing her once is the only thing in my bucket list... craving to meet her someday.  #theprettiestjihyo
Korean line is in the back and the foreign line is in the front on their final pose    Sorry for my bad english...
dahyun continuing to ruin my life
why do i feel so satisfied when Nayeon bangs her head with the signa(key point)
i love jihyo because she is very beautifull
Let's talk about how beautiful Mina here
i lobeu the choreo tbh ❤️️
'Hey let's all wear pants that cover our legs and not tell Jeongyeon.'
I already memorized the signal  dance and song!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I love Twice!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
who the choreographer??
This... In my opinion, was TWICE's hardest dance.  And MOMO catches my attention. She stands out!!!
Dahyun stans where are you ? T.T
0:53 is my religion
Sana saranghae! I'm so proud of her and Tzuyu and the rest of Twice. I honestly love this comeback so much
who is the girl with the ripped dark jeans and the striped sweater?
Is it just me or does the sound of tapping of the feet feel satisfying
lol time to memorize this i guess
I love this song, I love this dance. These girls are working their asses off (watch that last knee drop!) take care of yourselves ladies! Looking forward to KCON NY 2017
i learned the choreo for 2 hours a week ago(?) and this is not to brag because there's nothing to brag but DANG if there's anything to say, it's FRIKIN TIRING even after just one round
1:28 why this move tho
twice is so pretty on this comeback omg
Sana looks great even tho Jihyo and Dahyun are my bias. Ive always thought Jihyo deserved more appreciation
u r r8....Jihyo never gets that much appreciation........because Tzuyu steals all the appreciation of audiences by her beauty. Jihyo is really good and talented....but Tzuyu is always on top though she is not the most talented...whenever i saw any of twice's video, 90 percent of the audiences comment on Tzuyu such as 'how pretty Tzuyu is.'
Their outfit is just simple and casual yet it looks great and stylish to them : )
So beautiful !!!!!!! love forever
i love jhiyos eye contacts thier beautiful
i love you twice #newzealeand
Jihyo is shining in this comeback, she has always been beautiful but this cb made her look so stunning 😍
Sana is just a goddess with a beautiful face and perfect body ~ just cannot stop being attracted by Sana     Btw this dance version looks and sounds way much better than the MV lol
this is the cutest choréo I ve ever scene too much aegyo!!
Not once, but dang Dahyun and Sana are making re-think that lol
why cant more girls dress like yungjeon
I think Momo is the best member of this group
jihyoooooooooo I love youuuuuuuuuuuu
WHY AM I FALLING FOR DAHYUN. i have always been a loyal sana fan since the very start of twice, don't do this to me
Ji Hyo is really pretty. It's so sad because most people thinks that the thinner you are the beautiful you become. most just recognize her after losing weight. 😔 she's beautiful for me before and after.
did anyone notice 2:30  when Jeongyeon wronged the part ?? 😆😘😘
didn't expect that I'll be a fan of this grp 😭 stans momo and nayeon!! 💖
can come to hong kong
2:22 I though jeonyeon was gonna hit the mirror lol
Someone forgot to tell Jeongyeon that it was pants day haha 😂
Tzuyu love you😘
alone at home, so lemme enjoy this videos in high quality 😂😂
lets get 1M subscribers for twice!
can hear them breathing at the end and that is eargasm
I love listening to their shoes on the floor XD
Just realise that they remove the sofa because not enough space to dance.........  That's why I feel something weird when first saw.......  Or they are in other room?
@02:31 i think half or 80% of people watched this didnt notice that jeongyeon made a mistake hehe!!
All of them is so pretty in this comeback specially thes 3 Jeonyeon JIHYO Momo well Our Makne is always pretty
Me: 'Okay 1 repeat = Focus on one member'  Then: Ended up looking at Jihyo most of the times during the 9 repeats....Jihyo ;-; Wai
i really love the choreography 💓💓 i'm loving signal srsly
I think jihyo and momo are very cute and pretty
+Sophie the once OMG REALLY?! IM SO FUCKING SLOW
Sophie the once  yes 😂💞
Gia Huệ Bùi they're actually twins 😂
Jungyeon messed up a little at 2:30 😂 but she's still slaying and it took me 30 times to watch it and noticed and only if I didn't stare at her at that moment I wouldn't have noticed 😂🙌🏻
is nobody gonna talk about how chaeyoung is slaying in that outfit??
I like sana's jeans where did she bought it
ok ok this is BAD
jeongyeon made a great recovered after making a mistake in the dance tho!👌
omg jihyo rekt my bias list lol she's so beautiful 💋 💓
I love dahyun's sweater here it's so cute!
2:05 so cute and funny haha 💕  she forgot her part😂❤❤    
Gravitate Carentibus who??
Does anybody know who made the choreography? I think it may be my favorite since TT :)
i love the fact that this is so easy to learn (:
Momo's like the next hyuna omf, and chaeyong's clothes on point guys
Jihyo Effect... streaming countless times just to get a glimpse of Jihyo. Omg...she is damn beautiful.
我喜欢子瑜和sana  I love zi yu and sana
krys i think you are under a wrong impression...i have a jihyo named folder on my pc which has 100s of her videos and its size is approximately 25gb...I am a die-hard fan of hers.  You should have checked my comments on her other videos as a proof. I have been her hard-core fan since loa.  Conclusion- Think TWICE before you say something.
Asit Kislay why didnt u stream her before this? because she changed her looks?
doesnt jeongyeon get hit my the mirror when she dances next or beside it too close?
The brightness is too strong i cant see their nose. Stop! they already pretty without the brightness!
Did jeongyeon just tried to knee herself in the face? 😂😂
I love *TWICE*!!!
thank you!!!  I'm from JAPAN!!!
1:29 Jeongyeon ur trying too hard Ahh our Jeongyeon we all love her
last time Tzuyu get the attention of being pretty now jihyo, I admit it black hair w/bangs suit her.\u003c3 (I CANT STOP LOOKING AT HER) i hope her knee is already ok. Chaeyong slaying the outfit tho @_@
this dance is....can't see!!!    ....look not good...
guys if you have time go into my channel and watch all my twice video! thanks!!!! ^^
2:30-2:32 jeongyeon got it wrong
mọi người vào kênh top 8 bí ẩn để xem những video mới nhất của mình nhé! thank you!
Safi MarkBam Black is the new black? What does it mean? My English is not good so I don't really get it, can you tell me what it means? Btw I love Jungyeon and Chaeyoung so much
BLACK IS THE NEW BLACK i started to fall inlove with jeongyeon here.
Did anyone notice how Jeongyeom made a mistake at 2:30? Hihi its very freaking cute! \u003c3
It looks easy but it's actually soooo hardddd! Those fancy movements of fingers are so complicated!!! Twice is great!
Their hair must be damm messy after the dance
the choreography for Twice is always really good and displaying all of them, most girl groups just do the everyone moves to the back except for the one singing move, but Twice is really good about making the dance flow.
I think this time.......YES, JYP create some of their KILLING POINT MOVE like in the chores, HE the one that came out with the song,,,,if you familiar with JYP type of work,,,,if he has if involve in song production like GOT7,WG,2PM, UNNIES, EVEN IOI....he will definitely involve in the dance routine......BUT still they using/HIRED other CHOREOGRAPHER to SHARPEN the dance with the SONG.... not sure whether its LIA KIM or not
Are you sure? maybe she did it for TT but i remember on Happy Together twice talking about JYp making the choreography for Signal
ingrid V  Really? She did made the choreo again. She's also the one who made the TT as well right?   I wonder if she's also the one who did the choreography of Knock Knock or any other songs, I only know she did the TT. lol
ingrid V really?? I love her! All of her choreographs are so amazing, I admire her.
PrinceInShadow i may inform you that jinyoung park did, in fact not make the choreo, but Lia Kim from 1million dance stuio did
Momo dance is too power, so she not sync with other. Just my opinions. Or the fact that she want it, I don't know.
Sana and Nayeon are so gorgeous.
Now idk who's my bias, but I'm proud to say that Jihyoo is really my bae other than Sana. \u003c3 And I'm fkin proud cuz she already gets the recognition she deserves. I'm proud of you! Twice! \u003c3
i finished learn this dance i love it.....  my bias is nayeon...  nayeon slay...
Jeongyeon why so sexy😘😍
naeyons hair is so fast to grow  I love you naeyon and momo
Tzuyu and momo has the best body dont get me wrong
I am always amazed by how well they can dance +_+
Since this is definitely Jihyo's era, I hope next comeback Chaeyoung will get lots of attention cuz my baby is so underrated😢💔
TWICE's pet hamster Chae? She's has she got lines unlike dahyun all she did was say that one like which reminded me of nayeons 'I'm gonna be a star'
Yeah I hope so too. Chaeyoung and Jihyo are my bias in Twice. I feel like both of them are underrated so I'm glad that Jihyo got to shine in this comeback! I wish next comeback is chaeyoung's era because she's such a talented member💕
always with bts you're right she's MINE
im not once but i actually really like jihyo     (also her body is great where can i get a body like that :()
I think that this dance is very cute but I don't get the same excitement as I do for the other songs. Like, there's something lacking here.
Jihyo and naeyeon always take the main parts  Just glad the other girls got more lines this time
This has nothing to do with twice but...you know that couch, Where do they put it when they practice? But anyway I like this song a lot
Momo taking this dance way to far
I so want this and other TWICE songs to be available on Google Play, but they aren't which is annoying
Which one is Jihyo? Everyone is talking in the comments about her and I still have troubles recognizing them \u003e.\u003c
Thank you so much!^-^
Jin-Z's long lost rap lines the white shirt with jeans . black hair. 😁
I love the hair rubbing step 💛Momo and Sana look really sexy doing that 😍😘
Momo is the best dancer
It's weird how Dahyun doesn't match with the other girls clothes
who likes the sound of the footsteps??
i don't like it 🙄
Am I the only one who likes signal more than knock knock?? LIKE WAAAAAY MORE
This is so much better than watching the official video. :) Awesome choreography.
love you sana taxi taxi taxi
I really love Sana's hoodie . Lol . Anybody wanna tell me where I can get one ? 😂 anyways , I'm glad Jihyo is getting all the attention . She deserves it . 😊😊
I think Mina is the best dancer in twice momo is hardcore but she looks weird and not sharp but Mina is good
theres a reason why momo is called the main dancer in twice 😍 her dancing really stood up ❤❤❤ but for me theres no weak dancer in twice they are so versatile from cute dance to hiphop.
Man I just have to comment on Chaeyoung, that style suits her really
where can i learn to dance like this 😂
Jihyo fighting you're an amazing dancer 💕👍 jirrit jirrit
I didnt like Jihyo at first. idk why tho. But she just got the position as my BIAS WRECKER. Same To Nayeon, Jeongyeon and Momo.
their choreography get better loved twice
My bias Mina is so pretty and i want to see him..
Chaeyoung are you going to dance 'PARTITION' again??? your outfit reminds me your performance in partition on twiceland
Probably my favorite choreo. I think this is one of their more difficult ones too.
I love Jeongyeon's hair and Tzuyu's trousers.
ok firstly, i wasnt really twice's fan (not a hater though), but my bestfriend are so crazy over them, so her influence makes me starts to sing their song frequently, then she (my bestfriend) forced me to watch signal mv to increase the viewers, and somehow chaeyoung really caught my eye omg shes so adorable i cant unlove herrr! now i can even dance hahahah only the minor steps tho
I love the choreography omg \u003c3 my favorite part is at 0:34 😍  btw can anyone tell me the material of chaeyoung's shirt? pleaaseee I'm dying to know! it's soft, thin and light
who is that girl??? at 1:03 ?    she is my fav
I think 'TT' and 'knock knock' is better than 'signal', but they're cute...
I genuinely keep expecting a mirror to be kicked out one of these days.
momo dance is the best
is this choreographed by Lia Kim? like there are some signature moves of hers plus it seems like a song she would choreograph
This has now become my morning exercise routine ... 💊🤸🏻\u200d♀️🤘🏻🤘🏻
Omg ... trending #23 in Peru 😱😭❤️❤️    This is amazing !!   Twice ❤️
jihyo has always been there n becoming more pretty as usual
Jeongyeon Always Catches my eyes!! She really Hit the Beat!! Love you Jeongyonnie!!  By the way!! I love Sana's Cuteness Overloads!!
has anyone else noticed that they put all foreigners in the front row in the end pose? Wtf 😂
Why are we cheesing over JiHyo?  She's always sang 95% of every song anyways.    What about Momo who had little to no lines to finally having a good chunk of a song?
I really love twice, i always watching their dance practice and making it perfect as they dance. i really love tzuyu,nayeon,jihyo,sana,dahyun,and mina. i wish i can have some shout out from them or some of them read my comment T.T
i know their too much busy to read this nonsense comment oohhh please forgive me T.T
momo sarangyeou  nahyeon unni too  every member of twice i love you all
I love TWICE but I really don't like this song, I hope they can make JELLY JELLY MV soon. ;') sorry guys
i replayed it many times but my eyes are always stuck on dahyun baby dubu y so cute \u003e\\\\\\\\\u003c
jihyo for win
I love that I can still recognize them even with the dyed hair.
If I'm going to rate their dancing skills it's going to be: Momo, Tzuyu, Mina, jeongyeon, jihyo, sana, Nayeon and dahyun.
Muni A you forgot chaeyoung
i honestly was really exckted for the choreo because they said it was gonna be harder than the other but its actually really easy  oh well
I love itttt😘😘😃😃
jihyo i love u😘
oh my gawddd, dahyun an i have the same shoes!
This comeback made my love for Tzuyu skyrocket \u003c3 TzuSana is the best combo, both my biases and they both look SO GOOD HERE!!     Signal is the best TWICE comeback, right!!
Nayeon gets all my attention ❤❤
jihyo looking extra spicy in casual clothes
im now trying to practice em
Omg momo is slaying this choreography
Jihyo looks better with black hair than brown, she is getting the attention, she should have had since the beginning
ummmm i feel personally attacked by momo dancing... how is she so GOOD
I'm not Once but Sana always catches my attention. It's like I'm mesmerized by her whenever I watch twice videos.
I mean I'm a big fan of twice, but I feel like this song sucked lol.. I like the other songs so much more...
Their choreographies are getting to the same level as Blackpinks. Twice have improved so much omfg love them so much !!\u003c3
This comeback Jihyo is the best in Twice and perfect ❤❤❤Jihyo so beautiful😊😊 Any Jihyo stans here???
Suzy Queen   Let's be honest, Jihyo has been slaying since debut. Along with the others.
Yes I'll spread love for her as well :)) let's go jihyo
tiffany hwang park jihyo Generally the commentaries Tzuyu's name is Jihyo's name is very rare. I support him as a Jihyo fan. Jihyo's adventures are rare and you are one of those rare people. Maybe I read the comments that it feels lonely, I read the comments and laugh. I write to support her
jihyo is full package..stunning visual,powerful voice,energetic dance,even can rap,can cook...what else she cant do😍...indeed she is the GOLDEN LEADER!
munmun kawaii yeah shes my favorite among the twice members! she's the best vocalist and the best leader too
maybe be more clumsy than Sana
lets get 1M subscribers for TWICE channel on youtube😙!!!
TWICE: hey guys let's all wear pants for signal dance practice video    Jungyeon was not in that discussion.
out of 9 i got 6 people who really gets my attention even if i try to be fair i just cant keep my eyes off of them firstly its my golden girl JIHYO then MINA, DAHYUN, SANA, TZUYU and JEONG YEON i love this six girls but it doesnt mean that i hate the other 3 its just that i like them more!! im not comparing but in jihyo its as if i see suzy in her but shes got her own style if u know what im talking about..twice aja! (sorry for my bad english)
Dahyun, Chaeyoung, and Jihyo looks so sad in this comeback :/ *sorry about my bad englsh*
the sound of their shoes hitting the floor is so satisfying
Sana is killing these moves her dance here is no joke   and she's such a cutie and jihyo is HELLA GORGEOUS #nosananolife #jihyoissuchbiaswrecker 😍😍😍😍
Who else has mastered over 80% of the choreography within a week? I kinda have
Am I the only one who couldn't look away from Sana? I don't know why but I love her! Her dance, face, aegyo, voice! Twice is indeed made of gold! JYP better take care of them! Don't ignore them like what you did to MISS A!
the choreo is cool!
Mina is slaying that simple outfit. Just a white tee and black pants and white shoes. 😍😍
Just proud to be a once 💓
This is so whitewashed what the fuck
i dont know why.. but i dont like when momo start singing..
in my srsly humble and doubtlessly biased opinion, the best dancers for twice (at least in THIS exclusive dance practice video) is:  MOMO  trump wall  Sana  Nayeon      i srsly love their flow
I watch this 10 times a day...
wow nayeon you are cool
Momo is so stunning. And MiMo is matchy matchy in their clothes \u003c3
I love Twice♡
minaa and sana are soO Beautiful 😍
chaeyoung looks so damn good in that oufit
I think Jihyo and Momo are very talented. They have already devote so much in this MV. I think this is one of their most successful acts
Why I love jihyo a lot of..?  😭😭😭😭
I wish Dahyun can stand center,  and have more part
actually jihyo is the most talented one in this group
I still can't find the difference between the 9 girls. Their all like sisters, they look so similar it's crazy!
cant believe noone is giving momo props for dancing her ass off in this video. Jihyo pretty but noone moving like momo.
I'm getting them tingles from their signals lol
oml momo's passionate dancing, i love her charisma
i love what chaeyoung is wearing
i just love Momo. 😍
i really like there dance
fashionista Chaeyong on point!! Is it just me or Chaeng has a similiar taste style with Bambam?!?! They are a good dancer but Momo in another level
momo has this magic called 'swag' whenever she dances and makes you stare at her in awe 💖💖 saranghaeyo MOMO!
nakakaadik to wohoo ang ganda ng song pati sila!!!
Finally new choreography for these beautiful girls..
All these people calling the name of Jihyo. But im here Just staring at Tzuyu. \u003c3
My bias is Tzuyu but why do my eyes always stuck with Jungyeon? Huehue. But i love Jungyeon than Tzuyu. HAHAHA  PS I love the choreography.
Jeongyeon is #1 in my hearteu.
even for non-fans they will know that momo is the main dancer. her moves are perfect
my solid opinion     BEST DANCERS.  1.momo  2.nayeon  3.mina  4.jihyo   5.sana  6.jeongyeon(my bias)  7.tzuyu  8.dahyun  9.chaeyoung        no hate but replace that with more opinions
candys surgery ;-: Jeongyeon is my bias, too
candys surgery mine is like this too. number 2 will depend on nayeon. because when she's good, she's really good.
I love this comeback \u003e\u003c i don't really like other TWICE's songs but Like Ohh Ahh and Signal are both very good from music to dance \u003e\u003c
2:07-2:11 reminds me of mr mr 😂😂 btw nayeon's visual is off the list bruh she's killin' it 💕💕💕
why the last is middle is naeyeon my wish is jihyo
2:30 i saw that Jeongyeon oppa. HAHAHAHAHA \u003c3
I've never seen nayeon in boyish clothes, super cute!\u003c3
god momo is just so good - i mean all the girls are great but momo is just a born dancer!!!
i like this dance
i respect them...this dance so hard...😇
Best thing about twice they look so healthy! Not too skinny, like you can definitely see the youth within them 👌🏽
It seems like nayeon baby gets tired fast. Like  you can see how she breathes when after the dance compared to the others.. thats why i know she can sing but i guess thats why her mr removed before was a bit shaky.
When you want it to be Momo's era because the dance and line distribution is in her favour yet Jihyo's stealing this cb rip me
i hate momo's voice
I thought they were gonna do an alien hand sign but then they made a yolo hand sign 😂😂
I thought they were gonna do an alien hand sign but then they made a yolo hand sign 😂😂
Im so happy to see so many comments about nayeon
Momo was already perfect in her Blonde Hair T_T
I am in love with Chaeng's vocal 😍😍
i love you so much♥
I  absolutly love this choreography from Twice and I think all the girls look gorgeous in this comeback. Tsuzu really slays her dance moves especially when she takes the center. The lady in the black track suit with the white line on the side also slays her dance moves throughout the video. The leader surely dances graciously with her blue stripe shirt😊👏👏👏. In all they all danced beautifully.
I am not once,but I think Jihyo and Sana are really pretty
This is a very good song of Twice.  Blocking, choreography, lyrics, instrumental, these all are very nice.
Jihyo hair in this era is so daebak
i already memorise this dance steps loool :P
I love momo do much;;
Can we take a sweet hot moment and talk about Chaeyoung? Like oh my lord bless my eyes have mercy on my soul. She is absolutely stunning. Those legs ❤️😭
This song is really making me...oh...i guess i'm starting to like twice after all.
I couldn't get my eyes off of Sana
it's jihyo the great leader area!  💕😋
dahyun looks like she's too tired to dance 😅😅
sorry sana 😅  i cant take off my eyes from looking at momo till the end 😂
this is so hard to learnt * cry *  its good to see jihyo can dance ^-^  btw did tzuyu trying to be a ballerina like mina at the start 😂
The sound of their heels clicking is actually satisfying 🤤
How do they even dance in jeans. I cant even do a split with jeansn!!
I wish they didn't change their hair so often it's hard to follow who's who when you don't know their face
cant take off my eyes from tzuyu .. x)
tzuyu and sana singing the chorus T^T .. im lowkey crying rn... x) ... My babies.. deserves it!!
who else thought their were raps from chaeyoung and dahyun
is this their real channel
I can't take my eyes off of momo. Body and dancing goals.
Jihyo is still like this, we love you \u003c3
lol, all the heavy breathing at the end. Looks like there's quite a lot of fast movement in it though.
every dance practice I watched from twice since debut I can never take my eyes of jihyo, she's really charming. ❤💙💜
I love tzuyu like the other girls, but it's honestly so refreshing to see comments filled about the other girls and not just tzuyu for once \u003c3
I really like the girl with shoes
Sana slayed it Yeah!!
it's very very good i like it so muche👑💙💙❤
Jihyo resembles my math teacherｗ
Jihyo my baby \u003c3
Ah I really love that move with the arms 0:51 and the move at 2:13 so cute! I am living for this choreography
who else think this is much better that the m/v
Jihyo's era? Lmao I thought it was momo's oopsss
at time 0:32 the girl on her knees with brown hair a white shirt and black pants. what is her name?
omg my eyes r only on sana...... sana is not here to play, look at how hard she goes on her steps......she is one of the few to actually ruffle her hair 0:37 - 0:40 n that booty doe 1:40  - 1:46     luv u baby ^^
When you finally learn the whole dance but too scared to upload a cover on YouTube 😫
now i can know how good momo can dance...
omg chaeyoung and jihyo looking sO good 💞💞 i love the dance and the song so much✨
i love jihyo at first when they debut, and more love her when i was watched her in 'sixteen' , hmm maybe other have same think in this video , i think when watch this 'is jihyo still hurt(knee injury)?', is like she was watch her step when must use her knee so much..
love you momoring
looking great jihyo :)
Okay but Momo isn't flat. Like she has a perfect body 😍
why nobody talking about Jungyeon, seriously she is really pretty and talented, and I love her outfit here
i was trying to follow along with Tzuyu but damn this one is fast I'll need some more practice
line distribution/screen distribution is better, dancing is better, and many if not all members improved  i'm more and more impressed by them with each comeback and can't wait to see what the future has for them ^^
favorite comeback by twice \u003c3  proud that they're showing their amazing versatility
jeongyeon and jihyo get a lot of recognition in this song and I'm so happy
I don't even know what to say, Jihyo is so beautiful.
1:40 I was like OMG where's Mina :)))
Wow... is incredible Jihyo's beauty. I always knew it!! since sixteen!! extremely pretty \u003c3   That awkward moment when you're not twice fan but you're part of JIHYO STAND!! \u003c3 \u003c3 \u003c3 X1000
Sana is just like wearing jeans everywhere :0 weekly idol , knowing brothers :0
I've been watching this everyday, I love this dance so much 😭
Jihyo ❤️❤️😍😍😍she looks so pretty with those long hair wow
Is it me or Jungyeon now looks a like like Sooyoung from SNSD?? 0.0
ok, I don't like TWICE, of course, but I think knock knock is the best song they have... How can people hear this song??
Mina doing the twist is all I need in my life
i love the sounds their feet make at the same time
this choreography is so beautiful, i think it's my fave now. it has so many iconic moves and they're being so enthusiastic dancing it (they always are, but like, i don't know, i think it's more obvious with signal). and momo's having so much fun dancing to this, she's so cute, i can't stop looking at her. also, i'm so glad tzuyu's got so many lines in the chorus and her outfit here is really cute. i hope mina isn't sick anymore. they are all very beautiful and it clearly looks like they're having fun, which makes me really happy, and proud. chaeyoung in leather pants gives me life. the jjirit line makes me smile so wide and i can't stop typing, someone help me. sana and dahyun are as bubbly as always, nayeon's slaying her lines in the live performances, and jihyo's getting more recognition which is all she deserves. this era will forever be engraved in my heart. the song is so catchy too, heck..
this CHOREOGRAPHY is soooooooooooo goooooooood
Did anyone notice how Jeongyeom made a mistake at 2:30? Hihi its very freaking cute! \u003c3
im so happy that finally ppl noticed jihyo!! 💖
hey guys I just upload a pretty dance cover of this song ^^
sana seems more freer, she is usually put out as a cute image, but in this she seems cool-sexy.
song was  bad
And chaeyoung looks lovely too with short hair , eventhough JYP didn't accept if she cuts her hair short
Yeah broh ...jihyo stans LMAO😍😘💜💖, And fighting for every member ,  ' be strong ' , simple.
Ilove momo so much who love her with me? 😁😍
yow, this is dope.
how can my babies looks prettier everytime? Especally Jihyo omg 😍😍😍😍
being a jihyo stan since like ooh ahh im very happy she got her spotlight 💜
im watching this video 20x a day. im really not addicted to this dance video and the song
I like sana I love sana ^ ^
I know she's the main dancer but Momo's dancing overpower everyone else's. I kinda find it distracting lol its either momo tone it down or the rest should dance as powerful as momo so it'll look uniformed. She really is in another level in terms of dancing 👏🏻 No hate!! I just noticed it and i really like this comeback of them! 👏🏻👌🏻❤️
I'm new here who is the girl with the bangs, white shirt and black pants with the white line on the side. She caught my eye
Aline Thank you. She's so pretty. She might become my bias too lol
Potato Potato Momo, the main dancer, a japanese member and also my bias💜
For all the new ONCE:    Dahyun: The first one singing, yellow/white sweater. Red shoes (bro she will legit slay you)    Chaeyoung: Grey tshirt, black leather jeans, short hair (don't mistaken her for jeongyeon!)    Sana: Blue ripped jeans, grey and black striped sweater.     Mina: White shirt. Shoulder length black hair. White shoes.    Momo: White Tshirt. Brown hair with bangs. Black sweatpants. (My bias baby slaayy)    Nayeon: Red hair, blue flannel (bias wrecker. Will actually kill you)    Tzuyu: blue/grey shirt thing. Long brown hair.    Jeongyeon: Blue long thing. White sweater. Short hair (not Chaeyoung!!)    Jihyo: long black hair, white sweatshirt (is legit the definition of perfect)     At 1:50:    Top right: Jihyo  Top middle: Jeongyeon  Top left: Tzuyu    Middle right: Nayeon  Middle: Momo  Middle left: Mina    Bottom right: Sana   Bottom middle: Dahyun  Bottom left: Chaeyoung    Hope this helped!!!
* Chaeyoung \u003e\u003e\u003e cute his short hair  * Momo  \u003e\u003e\u003e super nice dance Momo  *  Nayeon \u003e\u003e\u003e Things to its red color for her hair  * Jihyo \u003e\u003e\u003e So beautiful  Twice really really good dance and sing.  Twice members is so beautiful and so cute  This is my new favorite song..
I'm so glad that Jihyo and Momo are getting the recognition they deserve. Truly, the spotlight is on them. But am I the only one wondering when it will be Jeongyeon's era? She is so pure and she deserves so much more.
Momo is always dancing at full strength, so hard to be cute😘
they are dancing with so much power and so clean to such an easy beginner choreo is so cute and funny at the same time lol
저 팬이에요^^   love  트와이스^^♥♥♥
i am once.. but i've never watch their dance practice more than 2 times. i feel their dance was boring (loa, cheerup, tt, especially kk it was so easy). but signal.. i watched it so many times 😂
love the dance keep it up twice :) :) from once in india
aku fans berat twice   kapan ya twice ke Indonesia    dan aku suka semua member twice, tapi aku ngefans dari yg lain jihyo tapi aku suka semua cantik2  i love jihyo
this has to be MOMOs favorite dance cuz shes going extra hard on this one
this video is #48 trending in ph woowww even though it's just the dance practice wow ❤
So, Onces decided to make our 'MASSIVE LIKE PROJECT ON TWICE MVs' on May 27-May 28. Let's make it happen guys. On that days, we just need to make 10 above accounts on youtube and like the five MVs of Twice. Let's do it onces! It's not so hard to do. Please spread this information. We need everyone's cooperation to make this project possible. Thanks! ❣
jihyo  my goodness
12th time watching this XD
also, wtf is with the 1:31 part XDDDDDD WTFFFF like wut
Everybody's talking about Jihyo all of them are slaying and Jihyo rlly does shine but can we appreciate how much Momo's slaying with this dance? ITS LIKE DAMN GURL
This is the M/V that they really gave all of their energy, the past was just plain actually, no hate or anything
the choreography tho   soo cool 😁😀😉
let's wear pants and not tell jungyeon about it 😂 lol ilysm jungyeon stay stable 💕
Jihyo....here u go.  Adorable as always...Jihyo IS undoubtedly the prettiest.
they are really really really good in dancing
Help, I can't find Jeongyeon's legs.. it's camouflaging itself with the background..
Can't take my eyes off chaeyoung's thighs.  Can't take my eyes off Mina's beautiful face.  Can't take my eyes off Momo's dance moves.  Can't take my eyes off Dahyun's beautiful smile.  Can't take my eyes off Sana's   perfect hair.  Can't take my eyes off Tzuyu's height.  Can't take my eyes off Jungyeon's perfect body.  Can't take my eyes off Nayeon's Smile.  Can't take my eyes off Jihyo's round face.   How am I supposed to choose a bias?❤️
Despite not liking Twice, love Momo's dancing and Jeongyeon's voice
I can never imagine what is a bad song before i listen to this song. Tks twice
the 'baboya' move reminds me of the guy in strong woman do bong soon so much lmao
TWICE I love you so much ❤️❤️❤️❤️😭
Nayeon looking SO mature this comeback 😍 she's really starting to look like a beautiful eonnie!
Suku R Whoa I thought she was still 20 😱 She looks greattt. They're getting older so fast.
i feel as though their dance got harder than their previous dances. And at first i thought the song sounded abit weird but after a while it starts to get better
星月 0.26 momo is in the center
sorry i don't like part of rap，but there still cute
Sana seems to pop more in the m/v, i feel like this is their best choreo though.
TWICE Please when are you coming to Spotify? I always need WiFi for you 😅😅😅
Jihyo you can kill me. 😍😍😘😘
The move at 1:28 looks like something you'd see an overly-expressive Italian parent angry at their child doing.
i heard tzuyu dislikes the choreograph for the chorus aye?
Momo is a super great dancer. ❤️
jihyo jihyo and jihyo....so many comment about jihyo in this video...    yes,,,i'm too...    JIHYO JIHYO JIHYO....!!!!
lesbi honest, they look the gayest in those kind of outfits
Not a huge fan of this song but as usual, their choreo is super fun and entertaining to watch.
I really love Jihyo from the start. She is my bias in twice. I was so sad when people don't appreciate her talents especially her beauty. One of my wishes is that Jihyo will be recognized and appreciated and I always pray for my wishes to come true. I'm so happy that finally Jihyo is getting the attention that she deserves. We love you Jihyo and of course we also love other members ❤
Im new, very new, and I see alot of comments about someone named Jihyo(?) Can someone give me names of each member, there are a few girls who caught my eye, i liked their dancing, but i wanna know if Jihyo(sorry if thats wrong) is one of them, there are alot of positive messages about her😊😊
You're welcome, feel free to ask anything 😊
+Bru Wow, ok thank you so much!! Ill try to remember them now.
Aaliyah Wells 0:27 from left to right. Nayeon-Mina-Dahyun-JIHYO-Momo-Jeongyeon-Chaeyoung-Sana-Tzuyu.   Jihyo is the one singing the chorus at 1:02.  Jihyo is the leader and main vocal, she trained for 10 years (since she was 8).
I mean, Jihyo has been one of my biases since the beginning \u003c3   And Momo looks SOOOO happy, this choreo is MADE for her!  Also Sana is too cute for my heart to handle \u003c3     ^My biases :D
Love This Very Much Buddy here to support Twice #CanIJoinYourFandom
Well, the dance is getting better and better too! You guys are quite awesome...^.^
at this point, I don't even know who my bias is anymore. they're all beautiful
Wonder girls used to post practice video in this room. I miss them!!!
love how momo put up a lot of enthusiasm in dancing
5M this is the fastest a twice dance practice has reached this
diibii well the choreo slays so 👏👏
i thought that this was mirrored dance practise 😂
amazing!!they are so pretty!!!❤️
Mima she is the most outstanding I love you the most.
the way they change their formation is amazing, tidy and clean af
THRICE will keep talking TWICE cant even dance after watch this.
damn Mina is as white (if not whiter) as her white t-shirt
I'm hoping that JYP would train the girls harder.because I saw some comments,they're under estimating twice,,I'm worried about their vocal..please train them..
In my opinion, I don't like the part 'Trying to let you know, sign eul bonae, signal bonae' and the part after that. :/
Since today im oficially in love with Jihyo, she became my bias wrecker -sorry Sana and Momo-
henry thomas Dahyun is my bias 😍😍. She's so cute!  Although, Jihyo is my bias wrecker 😅😍
I never realized how good Sana is at Dancing  seriously tho, just look at her through the whole video!  She pops her hips soooo well
they're going to break the floor in a few months
jihyo isnt that skinny but why her body is so perfect for me omg
2:05  The girl in the white shirt, on the left.  That hair flip was not part of the choreography. DISQUALIFIED
The choreo for this song is awesome... But doesn't anyone think Dahyun got less lines this time?
i don't know why, but i very like nayeon part
Dahyun Jihyo and Tzuyu are the best
Jihyo my ultimate bias😻😽💜
Momo stole the scene completally \u003c333
Has anyone noticed how their dancer have had more movement to them and they've been improving on being stable :') im not crying you are
Who is the girl with the white shirt and black track pants with a white stripe down the side?  I'm loving her dancing.
Oh the choreoghapy in 0:37 i want to do that..hehe ;)
the stomps of their shoes adds to the beat
I am a buddy and I am so happy for Twice because they improved in this era. 👍
I had to watch this 9 times for each member
chaeyoung with her bold lip and high waisted black leggings look so good \u003c3 such a subtle sexy!
Cartaxo  Olá, meu nome é Paty.Quando começar a ler essa mensagem, nao pare.Há 5 anos eu morri atropelada,pois uma garota que dizia ser minha melhor amiga me empurrou na frente de um carro.Envir essa mensagem a 10 musicas, ou as 2:00 horas da manha dessa  noite eu vou aparecer no seu quarto e te matarei
I'm alien and I come to earth support TWICE ^&^~
ok I'm a once but this song is so bad imo
Kheyyun Y. the song is still bad imo
fwyre shut the fuck up
Jihyo stop it...I've been a loyal Momo stan, don't do this to me T.T
can we talk about how good chaeyoung looks in this ??
Jihyo my leader so pretty and beautiful. 😍😍😘😘😚😚
I was fixated with tzuyu!
this dance is surprisingly easy to learn (learned it all in less than one day altogether) its just really energetic lol
what is the filter on this video
jihyo is really pretty in this era
Who else has mastered nearly 95% of the choreography within a week of release? I Kinda have lol
Es la coreografía es más mediocre que he visto, incluso más que las anteriores ._.   Por sixteen se que las chicas pueden bailar muy bien, pero las coreografías que les dan para cada comeback las hace ver como si no supieran hacer nada más que mover las manos como en Knock knock, o en Cheer up o en TT, La mejor coreografía que han tenido es ''Like ooh-aah'' Pero después de eso, solo quieren hacerlas ver lindas en lugar de talentosas.
Where are all the Jungyeon stans???
손복금 me to  !!!
Damn, that's a lot of steps :O
We can all agree this is Jihyo's era YOU GO GIRL but also damn my eyes keep going back to chaeyoung \u003c3
Jihyo looks amazing this comeback. The hairstyle suits her so well. Tzuyu is getting better and better, my most beautiful baby. They all look so good.
I'm not even a once but I think I've fallen in love with this song
minhas bebês,amo vcs 💗💗  my babys ,i love You💗💗
I know this whole dance now, and also the one bit that gets me every time..  Iit's obvious to see my Momo is the main dancer, for examply look how much energy she puts into the whole dance, and I can't take my eyes off of her at 1:57
Sana dancing is one of the best
i love every footsteps heard on their dance video, it's like they're in sync perfectly.
the song get better the more i listen to it.
I couldn't take my eyes off Sana for some reason....she's not even my bias
I think this is the first time I'll have to take time to learn a choreography by Twice
I'm happy you're not Sleeping on Jihyo this time 🤔
i love TWICE
jeongyeon dance is the best
Is so beautiful the love that Momo has for dancing, you can see in her movements, she loves to dance !!!
Sry JYE pd-nim for disrespecting you, You did everything so perfect, except if you had that 'sinel bunae.....' bit more interesting then it could possibly be the song of the year
nicee song after knock2 but please jyp let them rest after this comeback
The song isn't that great - especially the 'rapping' parts - but that isn't the members' fault. They didn't write/compose it.    Twice choreography and performance is flawless as always :).
who else notice jeongyeon cute mistake?? 😂😂😂
I can't my eyes off of Momo!!!!!!!!!!
Congrats on topping the charts even with a trashy song.
I feel like i'm the only one who's watching Sana during all the video, she's a really good dancer and her dance is really feminine
Momo really shines with this choreography, she's so good!
Twice the best rap,beutiful, cute and all is chae young, but dance is mina     When ppl ask jihyo or yuju,wendy,rose all comment support yuju,wendy,rose say them was better than jihyo, just me to support jihyo and telling the truth, but now? just because beutiful and support jihyo don't know how to appreciate jihyo ....     The voice of jihyo is really noisy, (their voice is very noisy also, not only jihyo) but when jihyo singing daring woman has a warm time also! I'm really sorry to say that, I really have not heard their warm voice ....    When jihyo cover any song will have the feeling, but when they cover any song did not any feeling .... (I not a hatter and not their fans, but I just telling the truth and guys more support the strength)
chaeyoung and mina in this video is so charming
they are so beautiful and talent ı hope every world know  twice  :D
why do they keep giving chaeyoung unflattering hairstyles
i cant get my eyes off of momo 😍❤
haters : oh we hate them cuz they can't dance nor sing  (-_-)   me : wether they can't dance or sing , it's none of your fucking jealous bitch ass problem so fuck off , and u could keep hating them asm as u fuckin want , they will never notice you , neither ONCE will ever be affected by ur shitty existence :* so yeah  , plus it is scientificly proven that hate just shortens ur lifespan , so yeah keep hating until u die and we get rid of your asses .l.
Rainbow , oh no they wish they'd block TWICE's success , they're not even close to doing anything , i mean besides helping the views yeah , but anything else , no
um i think thats exactly why twice has lots of haters, mostly bcs of the fans.. why dont u reread starting from when u wrote down ' me: ' and see what i mean..
 dont say that to thrice, just ignore them they don't deserve the attention  If your a once you should ignore the things that blocks Twice success  Onces should not judge Thrice instead say something nice because it ruins the image of Twice that makes other people hate them more 
Jihyo is finally getting the recognition she deserves \u003c3
Hhhhhh jihyo is having recognition  ever since debut.. But chaeyoung who is one of the most talented in the group is completely ignored
She caught my attention from the very start. 😍
shes always been my fav of twice
jihyo, chae and dahyun are so much perfect!!!!!!
I'm sorry but the choreo and the music is like favs out of all twice's single. So, who's the choreography?
am i the only one who find this better than the MV?
JiHyo was pretty in this video (No doubt)
did i see wrong but i think in their choreography they have one of the choreography of lovelyz previous song 'WOW' don't get me wrong I'm just saying
I always trying to focus on only one member, but fail miserably. All of them are cute, and my eyes can't focus at all. Watch all of them equally. How can someone has bias on Twice member? Why can't I?
What the heck was Tzuyu doing in the beginning 😂
love the choreo tho! ♥
everybody here is for jihyo, while i am here for everyone
everyone: jihyo is bias, nayeon is pretty  me: my baby jeongyeon is soo prettayyyyy yeahh
finally they are doing hard choreo . i mean most of their choreos don't need that much effort .
Im proud to say that since then, Im a Jihyo biassss
This is my favorite Twice choreography
trying to let you know  다현 솔로부분만 30번은본듯
momo and jihyo got so many attention this comeback. i suddenly love jyp
Choreography is great I love it but... pls too many hearts
'when you are too tired to do your hair' , do you guys undedstand it? 😂😂
mina's style look like a bam bam syle hahaha i ship them very much
to all haters.. TWICE now have do a hard dance ok.. so haters just shut off you mouth ..rest in peace now.. only to all haters TWICE
I love Chaeyoung's outfit like OMG 🔥
Although I'm not a huge fan of the song, the choreography is awesome
i love that choreography.. so sweet.,  a lot of heart..
me in other acount
They are so pretty
Sana is love Sana is life
Is it just her pants or my Jihyo keeps on getting skinnier. stop dieting now girl
If other members dance like Momo the dance will be more nicer 😊😚
Can we please appreciate JYP Ent. that they added the recommended video frame and logo only for the last 3 seconds not 30 seconds to cover the girls?  Please take lessons 1thek!
'let's all wear pants and not to tell Jeongyeoniee' hahahahaha i love them so muchhhh!❤
The choreo has so many elements with tiny gestures that make a differene. I might say it is the most complex they had so far.  💝👍
who is nayeon's fan here? 😍👋
I just love how there's so many comments about Jihyo, I'm not a ONCE, but I'm thinking about becoming one but she's so beautiful!! Like, a real goddess she is!
im inlove with this dance and song ♡
Everyone is talking about Jihyo, but as a new Once, I have no idea who she is, can someone please help? I know most of their names already, JUST JIHYO AND MOMO.
jungyeon dances with such power👏🏻👏🏻
who is who?
binged watched this for 2 continous hours and i already learnt the dance by just watching it. help me. I LOVE YOU TWICE.
i see double twice, is that dahyun's super power? 😅😅
Didn't like the song at first. Now I'm hooked.
Hey ONCE and K-poppers! If you love Twice AND K-pop podcasts then after this video check out Beyond Kpop's special TWICE episode (https://soundcloud.com/beyondkpop/the-episode-all-about-twice) We talk everything TWICE, from Sixteen to Signal and everything in-between! Hope you like it! Thanks!
Momo's dancing skills fits the choreo though
It's like all the twice members were like *Let's were full pants and not tell Jeongyeon*
I really like twice but their choreographys are kinda lame compared to other groups
TZUYU at the begining   Joking around 😂😂😂  My TZUYODA
I loved it ... the music, the dance, everything is very good.
Can anyone tell me which one is Jihyo? I saw so many compliments for her but I can't tell which one she is (I'm new to TWICE, sorry) XD
i like to be a kpop like twice.
Now , who says they can't dance? Back off , thrice
Yuup! She's killing it! Damn this girl
Lisa Liseu lkr, Momo is killing it!! Momo may not be strong with her vocals but her dancing compensates for it...
I love how Jeongyeon and Momo usually mirror each other in their choreography   #JeongMo
am I the only one who thinks that Momo slays this Dance Prac? 😂
I am not once,but I think Jihyo and Sana are really pretty
Cassandra Andres why are people criticizing her?????
They are both very pretty. Its sad though that a lot of people still criticize Jihyo when she's gold
is it me or are twice's dances getting easier
Mina is so beautiful but am I the only one think her moves is not as powerful as usual?? Hope that she's still fine!!
my bias is the one with the pants on
twice choreo is easy?     eat this haters. in your ass
Omg I love how they almost all are wearing long trousers and how this choreo is cool. Sure, they are cute and sexy, but this is much much better \u003c3 I want more cool girls in Kpop :)
They'd improve their dancing skills. No more words to say, just proud ONCE here.
*Watches* Damn Jihyo Momoring and Penguin Mina are only wearing a white top and beautiful *Notices me* Ew im ugly
they make simple jeans look so good.
Jihyo so gorgeous in this video!!! \u003c3
韓国人のツイキャスで知って見に着たけど、歌もいいし踊りもかっこいいね  this song and dance is good
They slay this choreo! I'm obsessed
momo is my bias but jihyo rocked this man
can someone tell me who is who
i love that everyone is wearing pants jeongyeon is like nope my legs are beautiful better show it off    no hate pls
I really like the choreo especially the part where they execute hearteu sign. BTW I also like this song becuz Jungyeon got more lines. SARANGHAE TWICE \u003c3  'Signeul bonae signal bonae~'
This is how dancing would be in heaven
I love tzuyu's outfit 😍💕 also jungyeon's 💕💕
I'm in love 😍
this song it reminds me of wonder girls Like this lol
why did they make the girls wear tight jeans and leather pants? the choreography has challenging parts for legs.
So I think I got it. In order for Jeongyeon's hair to grow they had to sacrifice some of Chaeyoung's to the hair gods.
I FREAKING LOVE THIS CHOREOGRAPHY OF TWICE and i love dahyun & chaeyoung's part SO FREAKING BAD. I hated twice at first and now look at me. oH GOD HELP ME.
Am I the only 1 to think that they look like they have anorexia?
I guess you can only see momo's clothes and hair.
I'm in LOVE with this choreography!! So fun to watch, I already wanna learn it :o
We all know Momo is a great dancer, but I think Sana needs a raise and get more attention as the lead dancer, she does every moves fully and add her own flavour to it, very fluid and powerful but not exaggerating. So precise.
I'm not a Twice stand but I check thir comeback and their dances bc their songs choreos are really catchy, I know Momo dances really well but for this comeback Sana also caught my attention. She seams to be dancing her heart out and it makes her look really good.
Jojo Tiong finally someone else see Sana as a lead dancer too. Her movements are always so precise and charming.
2:56-2:58 something looks out of place. Was that on purpose?
I wish it was less bright??
Woah.. Twice actually went really hard in this choreo! I don't give a fuck what other people think, best comeback they've had yet!
JIHYO IS SO PRETTY 😍😍😍 I'm in love with her. Marry me please ♥️
my bias in Nayeon...   but Momo and Jihyo really caught my attention on this comeback    didnt like the song at first,  but now its stuck in my head...  😁
Japan line will be the death of me😲😲😲😲😲😲😍😍😍
Haven't seen them in casual tho...😍😍😍😲😲😲😋😋😋
let's not tell jungyeon to wear pants.
so far the intro of every twice title song has a really cool beginning
i really love mina's style 🙆😂
Who is the girl in red shoes? Her hair is gorgeous it fits her well
TWICE : Lets wear long pants and don't tell Jeongyeon ....JEONGYEON : ( enter the dance room ) what! why only me wearing short ( feeling TT ) :) THIS JUST FOR FUN GUYS ( sorry for broken English :( )
the haters are shaking right now
jeongyeon is wrong at 2:30-2:32 hahah i just noticed it lol
how come they have different formation when they performed this on weekly idol?😂😂
jeongyeon and chaeyoung have such cute hair im in love \u003c3
wow their formations are really cool!!!
#35 on trending here in Hong Kong! Twice slay! Even their dance practise video is on trending !\u003c3
At first I was like 'Why so much hearts?' but then when I kept on watching it I was like 'ohh shit, now I understand why there's so much heart'   I LOVE THIS SONG!!! IT'S CUTE!!!!
TWICE's best choreography so far, Jihyo is slaying in black hair 😍💞 Chaeyoung's vocals tho 💖 Momo deserves the line tho 👌
This is #32 trending in Taiwan😂😂 Does this *dance practice* video trend in you country?😁
no No NO NO NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!, Please stop the liiiiiiikes
k but btob really need some fame cus they are sooo talented
who loves Jeong Yeon think she is beautiful ,smash that like button ！！！
welcome to Twiceland :)
How can their hair still look perfect after all those hair flips :---(
MOMO!! 😍😍 she dances so well! but actually they all dance so well ❤️❤️ loving this comeback ☺️
JYP always got tzuyu doing the most for dances haha
Was staring at Ji Hyo the whole time~
this my new favorite song
For me, Sana is a good dancer than Mina. Mina is good in ballet so in this kind of songs/dance steps I find her moves awkward (sometimes) while Sana, she dances powerfully, cute and sexy at the same time.
Why is this getting so much hate? honestly this is my favorite twice song.... and this choreo is the best of theirs to me... I wanna get into them now... help? I don't know basically any of the members... ((p.s jeongyeon needs love ty ♡))
i really love twice. their dances are always sooo creative
Finally tzuyu and sana singing the chorus
i don love this song at first but now i love it soo soo much😂😅😊❤❤❤👍👍💜
when Tzuyu literally have to step WAY back to make the team look proportional  😂
Momo popping throughout the whole song omgggggg bless these queens.
Momo and Sana slayed the choreography!!
that beat feet~
The hardest choreo by far. I'm happy for Momo
with that outfit (specially the shirt) Nayeon reminds me Park jihoon in the stadium
The song always gets better with the dance!
the last part. yes. i need a foreign line sub unit pls.
This choreography is the best! AND FINALLY JIHYO'S GETTING RECOGNITION! I love Jihyo❤️ They look great this comeback😭❤️
did i fell in love to 9 girls at the same time? sh*t whats wrong with me
Momo SLAY!!! the choreo
Ok so, I don't really stan this group but I like them... right now I think I'm having a bias 😭 it's  jihyo (?) the leader. I just so love her. Her voice is so angelic 😍 I love her style of clothing here too 😭😍💓
I love TWICE
Momo and Jeongyeon are so extra with those hair flips
I'm stanning but I dunno where to start. Someone please help meeeeeeh! 😭
I love how the sound of their steps matches with the song
twice are always cute and beautiful!!
Dahyun 😍 Jihyo sooo pretty in this comebackkk 🔥
Someone please get my girl Nayeon a towel and some water, she about to pass out :')
woah its trending in my country ❤
I really love this choreography , hope next come back of choreography is like this
Momo is such a powerful dancer!!!! They should do more intense choreos so that Momo can showcase her talent \u003c3
I think I am one of the twice fandom . can I ???
At 1:28 what is the girls name in the center
the dance move, the beat song, the looks & charms, the awesome-ness. TWICE ot9 = perfection 💕💖❤🎀
lets talk about how pretty chaeyoung is
2:30 i see you jeongyeon 😂❤
The sound of their footsteps! They are in unison
I'm so addicted with this song\u003c3
I'm not kidding, I think me and Sana have the same shoes😂🤔. The whole video I was looking at them and I feel special now. Looking a the video again I think Jungyeon has them too!!😂😂🤔🤔. I'm probably wrong but oh well I still feel special
No one's talking about the members' close to invisible limbs when they come across the front lights?
ilove you twice❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
I really don't understand why this particular girl group gets hated by some??? like they didn't do anything wrong except be a girl group that is visual as fuck, actually good at dancing and if their company allows them to sing live and without the back up vocal track being louder than their mics they're pretty decent singers. Maybe its just me but coming from a non-fan prospective I actually like them, their image may be cutesy and shit because thsts what their company likes but I saw their Like Ooh Aah era and I think if allowed these girls can prove those haters wrong and be successful if not more from the OG girl groups like their sunbaes.
They're good dancers but they can't sing.
Why should we worry about what other group does.
Mithun DJ but they can?
KimV Rin, So you agree TWICE cant sing live too.  I thought I was alone.
They slayed,This is truly their best choreography yet.
They deleted my comment about them being famous lmao
After 2 days of watching this, I just now realized that Mina and Momo are dressed alike. 😂
The amount of 'heart shape' in this choreo is tremendous
i really dislike tzuyu's clothes lmao
I need Momo to be the mother of my children :(((
Momo's wearing a simple white t-shirt and a tracksuit and looks fine as hell. I wear that and I look like someone who didn't shower for weeks 😂😂😂
for people saying 'Oh mY God, TwIce CaNt DanCEe' *insert spongebob meme*, look at twice doing a dance cover of beyoncé's yoncé, and then decide if they 'can't dance'
Of course there's momo slaying  it hehehe sml. \u003c3
twice songs are the type that you have to listen to more than once if you dont like it at first bc TRUST.. it will become a bop
My girl momo be slaying on the first part I was like 'Y'ALL THAZ MAH BIAS RIGHT DER'
where is sofa in the corner?
who is the  main dancer in this band ???? Sorry, but I am not one of the girls who’s following Korean girls' teams
kpop 1D it's momo the one in the all white shirt and black pants with medium length brown hair
I think she is the blonde girl with short hair
army's where are you ?????
just can't take my eyes off MOMO .....
i like this song ^ ^
i love u so much, baby Tzuyu. no matter what i will support u and Twice
Can't take my eye off Momo, her move looks very sharp and nice!
korean members at the back ..foreign line at infront last pause.
But MoMo's body and how smooth she dances! Wow such a queen.
I don't understand why their so popular? Like, I like their songs don't get me wrong but they seem like a basic girl group.
Omo the girls get prettier every time I see them ❤️
can't take my eyes off jungyeon 😍😍😍
grandma Nabongs look so tired at the end HAHAHAHA
OMG this video is so white, I can barely see their hand movements.
All these people comin out from their caves all like 'jihyo 's so pretty omg, stan jihyo'    boi where were you when she was slaying from the start
She's been my bias since LOA era and I've been supporting her since SIXTEEN. She's just wonderful.
Right! She's been badd since Sixteen. Nice to see people finally waking up. She's getting more beautiful Everytime I see her
dont look at me She my 2nd bias at first but now she and Jungyeon are my ulti-bias-wreckers!
She has been my bias in twice since debut :D
as a fellow jihyo stan i have to second this opinion.
This choreo is actually hard as fuck! Good job twice💕
I like them so much  I like to cover their dance  So some like ?
it wasn't bad. it's pretty good. i like this better than knock knock. and the lyrics just fckig expressed my whole shinitz about how clueless he is. -_-
The dancing is very good but the song is very immature and childish. It is just catchy nothing less nothing more. Good job though.
Jihyo is getting more and.more beautiful!! wrecking my bias here!! hehehe go bae :*
the choreography is so lit 😁😊  Momo slayed it 😊😍😍 She isn't my bias in twice but she caught my attention on this comeback 😂😂
SANAAAA omg the way she dances. Totally overwhelmed by her charisma
i'm so gay for momo
i'm not a fan of twice but i can't deny that they improved so much, especially jihyo and tzuyu. i can't take my eyes on her (tzuyu).. ❤
although tzuyu dress like my aunt but she's still stunning
I hated the song at first but then I just suddenly like it for no reason😂
Linh Liny I actually hated it at first because kids outside my house kept shouting wrong lyrics ahahaha pretending to be cool
nayeon and jihyo are giving me life literally,they are so georgeus
The way Mina fakes the messing the hair part is freaking cute. lol
Not really fan of this song but as a true fan I support TWICE comeback!! Love and support from a French Once 💕🌹 #TWICEFIGHTING
Jihyo lost so much weight that I didn't recognize her at first . 😭She is starting to look like OH MY GIRL's Yooa.  Stay healthy girl and stop losing weight !
Who didn't see Chae until she popped out in the beginning? She so smol..
Love the song! Love Twice!
Can't get my eyes off Momo
Because of all the hate it's getting, I expected the song to be annoying and bad but it was the complete opposite??  it's a bop why have yall gotta be so hateful smh
i wanna be idol rn or even cover them in my dance school
I love the way TWICE gave a lot of hearts to fans! Keep streaming, ONCE! Don't forget to click like to show them our support!
truly their best choreo so far
Wonder Girls 'Like This' Dance Practice reminds me of their room.
I love Sana's dance!!!!
stomps are satisfying
am i the only one who can't take his eyes off Momo? She dances so well it's hypnotizing
Jihyo looks beautiful and more beautiful in every Twice's Era...... I LOVE HER SO MUCHHHH
sorry for the others members but it's jihyo era
YELLOW EXID Every line jihyo and nayeon sings are so iconic.      Ohh ahh, Cheep up, TT choruses and their singing parts in signal are so jammy.
Ok, f**k, enough of being thrice and denial, i am ONCE now. Byebye Thrice fandom :'/     Their choreography is the best so far, the song? I don't like it at first, but after few more times listening, i can get the new charm and side of twice. As usual, Tzuyu's part always gives me a strange feeling such as goosebump, cool and attractive.
that is a one breathless dance choreo. literally.    i wonder how twice could still put it off while they sing, damn. too much dance moves they actually slayed it
Dahyun is so adorable(she's is the reason why I stan Twice)
momo is the very sexiest girl in TWICE ..  and she is very good in DANCING..  that's why. i. really like her...  _my BIAS_ in TWICE........
out of all their choreo's this is #1 for me.
Momo is the BEST!!! ❤️❤️
🙆I love sana and dahyun 🙆  👭🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒🖒  ❤사랑해요❤
It's the hardest twice choreography but it doesnt fits the song.   It's too fast
I'm sorry twice but i really didn't like the song and dance 😑
the iso is too high or they was shining?
Haters/Thrice be saying they're lip-syncing LMAO
i'm addicted to the ' jiri' sound by tzuyu. I hope it becomes the next shyshyshy.
I can't be the only one who like the song at first...
❤️Chaeyoung ❤️  She always looks good even with short hair. 😍
Blue Soul i love Chaeyoung too♡♡
momo are different. her move is my life.
chaeyoung is such a goddess and i love her outfit here omfjfjhdh
twice: *let's do a pose at the end but no one tell jeongyeon*  poor jeongyeon lol
at first I was agree with an opinion that this song is the worst but now I love it! I'm just wanna say don't blame JYP please.
The first time hearing this song, I really didn't like it but now it has grown on me so much I'm rewatching the MV and dance practice like crazy...
saannaa why you so prettyyy
JIHYO UNNIE suits that bangs so welllll👀💋
I don't like your way that bring hearts so much, ...
jihyo's hair and clothes suit very well for her lovin it 😍😍❤❤❤
MOMO dances like she choreographed the dance 😂    makapilantik to si MOMO eh,  kala mo hahamunin ng suntukan si maris e.  Buti na lang ma poised  to si momo.  hahaha.  iba deeeen.  Ginalingan e!  I LOVE YOU MOMO!  Slayed mo si Acqoeh HAHAHA
nayeon has a great fashion..
people used to hate jihyo and now suddenly most people love them.. i just cant understand. she seem so beautiful from the first time i saw her and now ppl just realize it...?
everyone is talking about how beautiful is Jihyo!  but, can we take a look about how beautiful Sana's dance!? it's Dope!
Lets not tell chaeyoung that we are wearing the best shirts XD
aww, Mina :) my bias ever since i first knew about them ^^
this is trending no42 rn in Korea youtube
can't keep my eyes off momo.. 😍
I love u momo, sana,  tzuyu \u003c3
#TWICE #SIGNAL !!!!!! Im so excited with this song and dance  !!!!! My love !!!!
So yeah, here we go again with 'Let's wear pants but don't tell Jeongyeon.'   Hahaha. btw, they all look stunning ^_^
omg i hope they wont damage their hair at their comeback stages.
im not even a fan of this but lol its #42 trending here in my country XD
Like a hall of mirrors might amplify the light of a single candle, twice wil turn your hatred feeling into love . Never regret for loving them wew
Hey Guys. Check out my cover of Twice Signal :)
wahh their dance is getting harder
I love the song, the MV, the choreo, the members. well basically I love twice lmao twice fighting!!!
Trending at #42 here in the Philippines 😍     *TWICE IS LIIITTTT*
jihyo.. my bias list is.. omg.. who tf is my bias now
2:30 jongyeon mistake 😘😘😘😂  why everyone say signal is not good?  signal very catchy and very good too.😘😘😘😘😘😘
JYP put Sana, Tzuyu, and Nayeon in the center too much in this song. He should put other member as well
Ok so This is #43 trending in Philippines as of 6:27pm in Philippines   How in the world? TWICE POWER (Not hating on twice I'm a once) 
Somehow in this dance video the more I look at Chaeyoung she looks like Somi at some angles.....
It doesn't look like a dance. It looks like a group playing with their bestfriend
I love the beginning so much omg
I guess this is their hardest dance steps among their 5 mv's. so catchy!
army here to support twice.. fighting😍❤❤✌💪💪💪💪
waaah~ i think im starting to stan them omooooo~💓
is Dahyun the one with a red sneakers and yellow sweatshirt with white in the middle
momo unnie's dance is amazing😊
jihyo unnie is so pretty😊 and i love love love her voice💙
I really like this!
My eyes always go to Momo no matter what! I know she's the main dancer, but whenever she smiles so genuinely she loves dancing so much!!! I'm so glad she got to be in Twice TuT.
Let's wear pants and don't tell it to Jeongyeon HAHAHAHAHA
Watching this made me realize how much I suck at dancing ;-;
damn..can't deny it..momo always stand out the most during dance performance, there's something about her moves that catch attention
**Sana's thighs.😍 Like if you agree.
Hey, random question here. I'm not a fan of Twice (yet lol) so I don't know- but when GOT7 does dance practices they don't take the couch out...? Or maybe I'm wrong? Did they move the couch bc they needed more room or has it been gone for a while? Anyways, these girls are killing it! Great Job!
My eyes were only foused to Nayeon
0:52 If you look closely you can see a holy booty shaking my existence since 2015
Jihyo my baby 😍😍 finally getting recognition✊fighting
No matter how much hate they get..... They can't change the fact that TWICE is the trend right now. No one is perfect. ONCE will always be with TWICE...that's the truth... haters sorry not sorry.
wrong of me to say so but i wish nayeon wud always get the lead   go nayeon!
The roles are kind of reversed. Dahyun and Chaeyoung are not rapping as much, Tzuyu having the chorus all for herself. I like this.
This is not boring this is very interesting. The song sounds better with the dance.
a choreography with 99.9 heart sign...like the horrible song wasn't enough this is becoming really boring...
Tzuyuuu😍 Her 'Why' parts are soooo energetic that I feel my calories got burnt by just watching her dancing😂 I LOVE THEM AND THIS DANCE AND SONG💜💜💜
at first my bias was Mina but JIHYO OMIGOD STOP BIAS WRECKING
You could seriously take any still of Nayeon from this video and put it straight on the cover of Paper or Nylon.
jihyo slays that long hair!! and momo so good in dancing😍😍 and idk why some doesnt like this song
Momo was so good! Even if she is not my bias anymore, she stands out in dancing! Sana is so cute and adorable she is my bias, but Jihyo bias wrecking me.
why is no one talking about how well sana is dancing in this video omg
#45 trending in the Philippines 💗 Where you at PH ONCE?
i'm wondering how their hair keep going as they want 😂 *anyone actually understand me?
This choreo was clearly for the members who are 20+ no more lil girl ish 😂😂
look at jihyo😍...i love her so much😘
dahyun all the way!!
they slayed it
Beside me who also like the choreography?
the way momo dance is af.
Is it just me or Jihyo becoming more thin? eat well my baby 😟
I'm new to the fandom and I'm still learning names can you guys tell me their names please
jihyo eonni, love u so much💖💖
Nayeon is very very be unlucky!  Because Nayeon is too many center😐   And increase the number of parts Jihyo and Tzuyu!!!!  Tzuyu and Jihyo is good at song😍
#46on Trending in the Philippines! 😍😍😍💖
i'm reallyyyy glad that Jihyo is getting recognition but a little bad too that some people are just liking her now because she lost weight :/
Here is a list. try to fill out the names(no hate):  1. dance machine  2. adorable bunny  3. clumsy sweetheart  4. shy angel  5. maknae yoda  6. pineapple pen  7. tofu smile  8. aegyo caretaker  9. silly girl crush
قود توايس احبكم سارنهيه love 😍😍
Chou Tzuyu is my ultimate bias😍😗💖
i keep feeling uncomfortable when I see jihyo bend her knees .-.
the steps are easy tho
Awww dahyun looks so cute!!!!i like the parts of jihyun and nayeon and tzuyu!!
BTS_SEVENTEEN _LOVE you can see her in the original mv at the same part I'm sure you will fall in love with her
BTS_SEVENTEEN _LOVE no it's okay, in 1:04 the one who wears a blue jeans and white pullover
illkaisbear ummm sorry to ask but which one is jihyo

I'm new to TWICE, can someone please tell me who is in the center around 2:38 with the black and white stripes? She caught my eye but I don't know her name.
Bomi Jeon97   Thank you so much!
Amanda Angstadt   at 0:27 from left to right  nayeon , mina , dahyun , jihyo , momo , jungyeon , chaeyoung , sana , tzuyu
they slayed with the sharpness of choreography. My girls grown up dy 😭
Jihyo was the day 1 Queen from the start. \u003c3 #yayforjihyoappreciation

All for Nayeon
the dance is really much harder than their other dances
all foreign line at the end😍😍😍
wow most of this comments is about jihyo well what can i do go sana love u😍😍😍P.Si love you twice
I love Jihyo's hair
jihyo and jeongyeon are so pretty. tzuyu is so tall, i envy her
Let's wear pants and don't tell Jeongyeon.   At the ending: Let's all sit down and don't tell the Korean line.
I'm sorry but I cracked up at the initial part of the choreo where Tzuyu is doing that jumping thing. It's so funny like some sort of a pre school dance. I hope they get rid of that thing!
Chaeyoung looks soooo cute in Signal, love her 😍❤😙❤
All are look like same... Lol
Let's swim to South Korea Jihyo is so pretty♥
Loving all the love for jihyo but I seriously can't wait till y'all realize how hot Jeongyeon is
I just want to say that Sana's dancing is sooo good. I don't care what anyone says. She's a Lead Dancer.
Any tzuyu stans here? My baby slayys 💓 Jihyo did amazing too! ✨💓
Jeongyeon leg so white same as the wall colour😂😍
i love twice!!!!!!!
Chaeyoung's outfit is amaaaaazing, she looks so good here!!
*#47 trending here in the Philippines*
Never been a huge fan of Sana but her hair in this video.. Flawless
I love this look
me as a *Once-ARMY:*    SIGNAL BONAE SIGNAL BONAE   *JIMIN JIMIN JIMIN JIMIN* ❤️💙😂😂😂
Sana the second dancing machine
Am I the only one who loves Sana's part of the dance?? Like its Sooo cute!!
wow! so many Jihyo in the comment section❤👑THO I LOVE THEM ALL. Twice Fighting!
'Let's all wear pants and don't tell Jungyeon.'😂    Anyway, these ladies never fail to amaze me😍💘
Jungyeon slaying as usual
Finally Jihyo is getting more attention!! 10 years of training = NOT WASTED
momo is POPPING that dance
I'm still waiting to jeongyeon get reconition !
this choreography is so creative!!
Best choreo out of all title tracks also I best line distribution. Dahyun, Momo, and Chaeyoung hyping up the song, Jeongyeon and Mina getting all the verses, Tzuyu and Sana slaying the chorus, and Jihyo and Nayeon rightfully singing the catchiest part of the song. I love it.
I really love the choreo
this dance is too hard for me ~ but i like it !
#47 on trending in the Philippines!
when the dance video have more views on day 1 compared to real M/V  on day 1
who's who?
Even the dance practice is trending #50 in the Philippines ♥ Many people loves TWICE in the Philippines
Dahyun is really white I almost can't see her, ahaha but Jihyo stop breaking my Bias list.
who is the choreographer?
lmao even this dance practice is trending here in PH 😂
guys stream knock knock cause it is currently at 99 million views! let's get it to 100million views! while cheer up is at 169 million views! let's get it at 170 million views!!!!!!
omg this choreo is hard! + i like their signal don't believe in those fake once saying this is their bad comeback don't believe them!
Amazed with how chaeyoung and tzuyu look like goddess at such a young age, and i'm here with the same age as them look like a potato😊
Anyone noticed how lazy Chaeyoung as a dancer? I don't mean it in a bad way though but her movement is so minimal.
they dress like fucbois  i luv it
they are so far away from the camera :(
I'm not a fan of twice but this is their best song and choreo for me. But knock knock was also good.
I think Nayeon in this era is the prettiest out of all ❤️
it's amazing that their dance practice video has more views than some other idol groups M/V. ♡Twice!
They sound so light on their feet, there's 9 of them, there's so much energy in this song, yet they barely make any noise when they jump! Love these girls.
damn momo is so pretty and she is definetely a body goal
im so happy that momo and jihyo got the spotlight in this comeback especially momo bcuz in TT she got the least screen time least line and least center time
Bomi Jeon97 actually, momo and mina got the spotlight
I can never pick a bias in this group
nayeon looked so tired at the end... ;A;
*#50 trending here in the Philippines*
lindas as minhas nenem
'omg, look! my babies are dancing. so proud to be her parents'     -all twice member's parents
All I wanna say is I love JPY's songs so much
I couldn't stop starting at Momo's dance! She dances sooo good!!! Love you Momo!!! #yournumber1fan \u003c3
I love how all of them have body goals😍
so cute .. Lovely Song ..💝 Twice Fighting ..🙌 Love you Twice Girls ..😘
for sure this dance more more more good than Signal's MV  as like Suzy's Yes No May be. Her dance is more good than MV
I like Momo when she's dancing. I really like her.
The Chorus part steps are actually inspired by JYP's Still Alive Chorus Dance Part
i love twice😘😘😘
omg this is trending #50 in ph 💕
I lost count how many times I come here just to hear their feet stomps. Hahaha
Jin B mi to his the bast in this song ❤❤❤❤❤❤🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀😻😻😻😻
all twice members are so pretty, JYP's flower garden twice \u003c3
This is #50 trending in the PH 😂❤ PH ONCE go hard! Leggo!
after watching the dance video .. i loved the song ✋💗
Dude, this is brightest than my future
Jihyo is so pretty when she's natural \u003c3
I just see the comments about Jihyo and then there's me:    I. LOVE. EVERYONE. IN TWICE.   😂💕✌🏻😍✨👌🏻😊🔥👍🏻
This comeback is more dance oriented and I love it, starting to stan Twice!
Finally yes I can learn the choreography.
i love how they steps sound.
they are all cuuuuuter now!!!\u003e-\u003c
I can definitely see what they were saying about the dance being more tiring than previous choreographies haha. I'm happy though since we get to see Momo in her prime, I can't help but watch her the whole time. Just one complaint though... the filter they used here is a little too much, it makes it hard to see :(
may i have a favor ONCE and for all the people who watch this video ? lets make this video and the rest of their videos reach 100,000,000+ views . they deserve it :)this is what makes TWICE more amazing because their tracks target all ages . even adults appreciate their music especially the choreography. go JIHYO AND MOMO :) ILY
PLEASE :) thank you all mwaaah
I absolutely love how the girls finally got an even distribution! \u003c3 Absolutely love it.
I hate the song, but the choreo is so good.
this is my signal: i'm once forever♡
*Mina is slaying the dance move that looked like a penguin walk*
I must say that first time I listen to it I was not that impressed but when I realized that I listen to it 50 time it hit me this song is good 😅😅😅
Running Man 7012 lol I like it from the beginning and ji hyo dark black hair match her
Jeongyeon is so beautiful in this comeback \u003c3
all these bitter antis disliking the vid when the dance is obviously amazing lmao
Am I the only one who loves Sana?
I can't dance well but this is by far the easiest twice dance for anyone to learn!!!!
Mina my bias
Jungyeon my baby she killed it it was amazing
Momo's outfit is so simple yet she rocks it like no one
This is without a doubt my favorite TWICE song so far~! 💖👏👌
The hair color fit nayeon so well!!! Same for the outfit she has in this practice video, fit perfectly!!!! Finally jyhyo getting recognize!!! She is one of the best!!! And she is so pretty!!! Sana mina still pretty ad always. My top 5 in twice is probably jihyo nayeon sana mini mono/tzuyu :3
Why does everyone overlook by baby Dahyun? That's ok sweetie, I've got enough fangirl in me for you to challenge an army! \u003c3
Even if you're not ONCE you can't help but adore all the members 🙈💕❤
imagine doing this song 2× speed      im pertty sure i will laugh my heart 😂😂
I've always loved all their title songs but tbh I love this more than knock knock ❤❤
Glad they didn't turn aliens at the end
Did they totally add Kkap style in here?!???
twice in casual comfy clothes is my favorite concept
those deep exhales at the end tho
twice wont be bothered by hate. lol their all slaying. even dayhun and chaeyoung who use to dance with no energy.
I am so surprised and so happy that my  jihyo is getting the recognition she deserves. I thought it was gonna be another song she slays and no one notices but thank you for noticing her she deserves it😭😭😍
I watched this 10 times.  9 for all the members  and one more for all the members
Momo is just... Im just drooling. Tzuyu is also ICREDIBLE and then Sana is also a fierce competitor and lets not forget about Jihyo, although her body is noticeably worse than momo's.
love this song,not bad actually,a good try  imo it makes me think of wondergirl 'like this'
everyone: jihyo, momo, sana and tzuyu  me: new song of the year.
I really like the dance but not the song, but it's no matter because I love you girls❤️❤️
Okay but for real though this video made me have to burn my bias list guys. The feels are too real and now I can't properly choose. They all have absolutely shaken me to my core lol. But everyone looks great but we need to give Chae props because she came in like she owned this video and sure why the hell not. Also I see you Nayeon being cute as hell. Jihyo is a goddess and has blessed us with her presence yet again. Sana is absolutely hitting every move of the choreo hard as hell and I dig that. Dahyun and Tzuyu out there working hard, and Momo, Mina, and Jeongyeon are just casually out there stealing hearts and slaying unsuspecting ONCEs like it's nothing and I appreciate that lol.
Nayeon's part at 3:01 reminds me of Jessica's part in OH!  Both are my biases :')
I don't like this song !
this dance practice was like so different to others. is it maybe bc their dance steps was so fast or what.
this is officially twice's coolest choreography 😍😍😍
assala michin yeoja IKR its not really difficult but it's just so awesome and cool \u003c3
Finally jihyo is getting attention she's so beautiful why do people just realize that
Lmao watch them at sixteen chae and Jihyo is really pretty since predebut
one word to describe jihyo? its GORGEOUS
*They all look absolutely gorgeous with casual clothes! I'm so in love with their styles. Especially Sana and Chaeyoung! I can't stop looking at them! Jinjja yeppo!* 😍😍😍😍😍
No Sana No Life 😍 Where's all my Sana stans?
You can hear their stomps and claps so clearly and in sync ^.^
Finally people are giving my girl Jihyo the attention she deserves,  oml
There goes 27 minutes of my life! 😂
The comments are almost about Jihyo and I'm so happy that she's receiving the recgnition and love she deserves ever since 😭💕
My bias is Momo and I usually can't take my eyes off her when I watch their dance prac but for a moment I found myself looking at Jihyo?! Damn girl you're too much how can someone sing so well and dance great too 💕 Still gonna confess to Momo my bae haha she's just too precious
Listening to Signal while watching TWICE dance is so satisfying :D
they all look stunning ahhhh \u003c3 and Chaeyoung is so cute omg
I just have to say this but Chaeyoung's get up is so on point. I couldn't help but notice. I love the dance and the soooooonggggg! Gosh, Jihyo's part is so addicting to hear. ♥ Proud ONCE.
Mina is so beautiful ! I was to focus on Jeongyeon but she catch my eyes !
Look at Chaeyoung rocking those Carmilla leather leggings
my eyes are on momo in the whole video
jungyeon get the least line, and the choreography doesnt make her stand out in her part. poor bby
just can't take my eyes off Mina \u003c3
Not a big fan of twice but their songs and choreographies are always great🖒 also jihyo looks so good with black hair
I'm not a Once but I kept on downloading their videos..... I even have a folder of them in my laptop
I always see them wearing short short skirts . But they look really pretty like this ♥️😊
It took 4 mini albums for the Jihyo comments to flow in smh.
Tbh i noticed jihyo first when i was noticing twice and watched cheer up
Dahyun smiled this whole time man! Bless her!
I like Tzuyu's style!! it fits her perfectly!!
This is a different TWICE. I really love their choreography, specially in jeongyeon's and chaeyoung's part. It's like Momo's era.
I replay this 100x Huhuhuhu TWICE IS SO GOOD OMGGGG!~
Am I the only one who feels like they're gonna need a bigger room? Cause like, I get a little anxious when they're really close to the wall, especially when jeongyeon was really close to the mirror, like I always feel like they hit the walls on accident when they're practicing, cause their dances often have some pretty spread out moves, and it gets awkward with such a small space. Still a great dance \u003c3
in my opinion, i think the 2nd most powerful dancer here is jungyeon
Can Chaeyoung have more lines in the next title song plz? She has so much to give...
momo so slays with the dance
the dance is so fast but i am going to find a way to learn these steps
I'm so happy, TWICE is getting the recognition they deserve. ; ;
y r they whitebleached by the filter tho?
is it just me but this choreography is waaaay harder than any of their other songs. dayum twice is leveling up their game. slay 💛✨
2:20- 2:30 that hair flip is just fucking amazing. and the foot steps they make while dancing is so amusing
finally someone appreciates jihyo :3 my girls are amazing \u003c3
Asslee Is A ONCE where
This song with dance is much better than the song without dance
Is this the same room where Ikon/Winner had a showdown with GOT7 back when the 3 groups didn't debut yet?
yes it is.
I want a 2x speed version of this hahaha
I enjoy some of their songs although I'm not a Twice fan but just wondering why do they always have a lot of dislikes in their videos?
yeah, this is exactly the best dance practice video I've watched. TWICE fighting!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm so glad Jihyo is getting the attention she deserves. She is so beautiful and talented!
amazing
I can't stop looking at Sana \u003c3 😍 my god.. my plan is to repeat the replay button and see each member to dance but damn.. my eyes keep on looking at sana out of 9 times i repeat this video 5 times i was looking at sana \u003c3
how come i see no comments about chaeyoung she looks SO good
Jihyo & Sana & Tzuyu. I love you
I don't know why so many people dislike this song. It's refreshing and this is probably one of my favorite choreographies from them. Momo slayed!!!
the more i listen to this the more addicting it gets.. how is it annoying????
Smh, why Jihyo only getting the love she deserves now? I liked her since the beginning, but especially since they did the recording for the 'Sudden Attack' game and she made the grenade explosion sound herself, lol. 😂
Been here since ooh aah and Jihyo is always the bias! loVE HER
So the choreography indirectly  includes the running man challenge, Lol
chaeyoung has never looked better! \u003c3 love them all
Who's the one with the white sweater and blue jeans. I think she is my bias😍
lol all of the comments are about jihyo and my baby is finaly getting recognition .
i love nayeon's hair omg
This time, it's jeongyeon that didn't get the memo to wear pants or jeans 😁
All kinds of hearts that you could do with your hands are in this choreography..
I bet they'll win the choreography award. :))
Momo is like that person who was borned with the dance gene, her moves are strong and beautiful *-*  Jihyo just look stunning, i've never paid too much attenton on her, but this comeback she looks so good, she's even singing less than the others, but she's still shining, i loved her hair color.  Sana's so beutiful!
hey it's me cat, the plastical surgeon. i think i told you NOT to dance after operation!
Random thoughts:  ~ Not their best track, although possibly their best choregraphy. I think I like the dance version than the actual MV.  ~ This is Jihyo's best look so far (she's so pretty here!!), not to mention: Momo and Tzuyu are slaying the center! I'm so happy to finally see them rockin' at the center! I love love love these two \u003c3  ~ I hope their next MV is better than this. If this is not Twice, I wouldn't have listened to this the 2nd time.
Anybody notice that momo and tzuyu lower themselves to have the same height with chaeyoung and jihyo ?? So cutee xD
For real I don't like the song but the dance are very awesome 😎 !!!!!!
I don't usually click 'Like' on dance videos but this is da BEST 😍 SIGNAL choreo is littt! It's not only cute, but powerful and beautiful at the same time 😃 I absolutely LIKED it 😍
Who loves this song and dance choreo the best? I think it's the best choreo out of all the songs TWICE had before. It really shows their colour (cute, powerful, pretty, talented, sexy, gorgeous) 😍 Hear that steps they make... such in synch 💗 No wonder they are TWICE the best 👍😍
How is Tzuyu rocking that seemed to be looking 'old fashioned and dowdy grandmother clothes' ??? Tzuyu is perfect 😍 She rocks everything she wears 😍
Jungyeon is my bias. Her voice...💕
I don't know what's happening to me   My Bias is Momo (like if your bias is momo)  When I see Nayeon's Part there happening to me maybe she's beauty or idk
Sorry for my English
I really their hairs now!❤️😍
All of this MV gonna be a big hit! Twice is the best ~
Jeongyeon ah you're pretty with new hair \u003c3
men the choreo is lit. momo and jihyo slayed.😀😀😀
Nayeon and Tzuyu seems so very beautiful. I love the song. Also the choreography. It's cute.
All of twice songs and dances, this song and dance is the most stand out for me. Idk why?? 😂   They're so synchronized to me. I really like the dance hehehehe.  I love the way momo and mina dance this, as well as the other members. Jihyo is so pretty in here. I'm not their fan i mean i know them as a kpoper not as a fan, but I becoming a fan of them💖
this song is literally stuck in my head i was studying for exams and every time i look at my book i start humming signal i didn't study much but i got a perfect score what are the songs u make TWICE all of your'e songs are like my textbooks i don't need to study much just gonna sing TWICE songs
Jihyo is my queen 😍
who put a snapchat filter on the vid im choking
can we just have a moment for momo, she seems so happy and confident while dancing in this 😍😍🙌🏻
Where's my dahyun and chaeyoung stans?
Finallllly More ppl are commenting bout JIHYO!!!!She soooooo pretty!!
rabbit nayeon's pants are on point! sooooooooooooooooo sexy!
girl groups' dances are easy because they have periods and menstrual cramps lmao imagine having to sing, jump and do vigorous hand actions while on your period
Everyone talk about Jihyo and Momo but I want to appreciate Sana's dance my love
the dance seems easy but the speed is amazing
lol the jumping thing at first choreo was hella funny
1. jeongyeon deserves more lines  i understand her voice may be 'sassy' and 'not suitable' for twice's concept, but that doesn't mean that she shld keep getting left out! give her a chance to shine mannnn. and it's not only signal, all the other songs she got really little lines too, signal is the one she got the most lines (and its still so little.)   2. even when jeongyeon is singing, she's hardly in the middle   ??? where is the focus ???? where is the fairness   3. did i mention jeongyeon is so pretty & cute💯💯 always my bias  bbg, hoping one day you get the attention you deserve 🙏💓💖  ps. I'm not hating ok, just feeling unjust and pointing this out. Twice fighting! hope signal is well received 💓🔥\u003c3
Someone said Signal dance loooks like wow! by Lovelyz. But I dont believe that. the dance in Sana part isperformed in Jelly Jelly by Twice. You can watch Jelly Jelly dance practice. This is Twice dance not Lovelyz.
BLACKPINK is the best. They can do everything very well.
Momo is amazing
May I know who choreographed this?
to all the bashers of twice just support your idols dont bash our idols
I love shirtzu♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥
Jihyo keeps seeking my attention she deserves it 😂😍😍😍
it's on #37trending in Taiwan , how about your country ?
why jihyo looks so fat in here?but she's still pretty
So I was looking for a 'let's all wear jeans and not tell jeongyeon' comment hahaha :D
Why are there 13,000 dislikes
Had a hard time because everyone was ignoring my bias jihyo but I'm Glad now she's getting recognised:) this is jihyo's era yall~
Mina!!! You're so great! I love you....
the figure of momo \u003c3
The Korean destroys Japan  A Korean is an enemy of the enemy world of Japan  A Korean is not a human being  The comfort woman is a forgery, too
A good dancer really gonna looks like Momo. Her body seems so light while her moves are sharp and curved (you all know what I mean) yet energetic 😍
I love this comeback!!!!!!!!!!
the one with short hair and white shirt. the one who centered in the first part is a good dancer
The dance is really fit for young girls.
I like this more cuz the not is not cut by the story it make me easy to listen and the song not sound weird
Jihyo, Jeongyeon, & Chaeyoung 😘😍  'Jeongyeon the center' is satisfying!!  ~My favorite three bias~
they're my three biases too ^
This is THE FIRST TIME OF TWICE DANCING! hahaha thanks JYP THANKS! \u003c3
is there like no one talking about jungyeon , dahyun and chaeyoung? love them♥
My love, Momo, I love you.
Did anyone notice Jeongyeon made a mistake at 2:30? 😂 But still they're the Queens ❤
I love signal so much ahhh😻
ohh excellent.. I know about Twice very soon, but I didn't think, that it is such a cute group.. I think that I'm becoming once right now.. Onces can you help me? Can you tell me little bit about Twice ?
I'll never get tired of saying how Jihyo crawled up my bias list so fast. I hate myself for sleeping on her back then.
I'm so happy Jihyo is snatching so many wigs in this comeback. She deserves all the love
Everyone mostly talks about jihyo here. Lol i cant disagree that she's been recognized more for this time's comeback though
Jihyo looks like an anime character with her pretty big doe eyes, long silky hair and perfect body. Goddess indeed
MOMO's moves is eye catching. She stands out when it comes to dancing😍
When Jeongyeon's legs are brighter than my future.
Compared to their other songs, this one has the hardest choreography.
i feel like watching Miss A with 9 members  i mean it in a good way  Miss A's dance usually has such a speed and powerful movement (like in this dance)  i think JYP pdnim did a great job for this song  i know maybe some people dont like this song and prefer their previous song, but not for me  i love this song (and i love their others song as well)   and i love this dance video even more
struggling so hard even in their dance practice video lmao...
Honestly, their debut song was the best
Tzuyu and Sana's part was my favorite 😍
omg the dance!!!!! choreo on point
wtf? this way they dance for their new song it so boring.... I don't find any thing too hard in dance video. Twice just is flowers and they don't have any talent :)
Am i the only one to notice the small mistake of Jeongyeon at 2:30?
the best choreography out of all their songs..i love it..
idk why but I feel like people are overlooking Sana and Jungyeon's dance skills because of Mimo. I mean the two are great but I feel like Sana, especially Jungyeon, is so much better than Mina. Same with Dubu actually. and Nayeon is really good in dancing here. I have always thought she is the weakest in Twice. I change my opinion, there is no weak dancer in them! Chaengie and Jihyo though 😍
Hello. I enjoyed your video. And I want to say it's great. It would be great if you were interested in my video. Thank you
i can't see their skin😐
someone give their choreographer a 100% raise
Even dance is good and cute! Why they have many negative responses?!
am I the only one loving this song
hope dean exactly like me the choreography made me fall in love with the song 😍😍
they're soooo... stiff and lifeless. omg LOL it's so obvious the girls aren't so fond of this song either
The dance choreo is lit af I love this song
❤️I'm in love with Jihyo and Tzuyu ❤️    ❤️Twice ❤️
love this song
how can they be so beautiful???
why do people dislike this song so much? am i the only one who thinks that this song is better than TT and knock knock? haha
this dance moves is tiring...😂😂
Jihyo looks like living doll she so beautiful
wowww the dance is so fast hahahaha . they must be tired when they practice 😭
I thought that was niko niko ni hand sign from heechul momo moment 😆
Bruh not even a Twice fan but this is my jam & the choreo is so energetic and groovy..
Flapping their hand up and down is soooooo jyp..
i see some wonder girls' moves in this choreo and i love it \u003c3
Love coming here and seeing all the comments about jihyo. Always been a fan it's nice to see the international fan base recognizes her more then the Korean base.
KKAEPJJANG!! Here's ARMY for supporting Twice!
Twice's dance choreography is always catchy and easy to learn... Love it😍😍
funny, they look like crazy girls xD
Just noticed that the ending pose has all the non-Koreans in the front 😋
I love how they dress. It is so cute \u003c3\u003c3
Did they use filter
Bts Infires me like the jibooty in 01.31
Bts Infires me like the jibooty i do't try to make fanwar, it was a reallity hahahahah
Justin Seagull how? stop trying to make fanwar
mina looks so beautiful when she wears white t&black jeans
twice no like this
is jihyo okay?? does she feel any pain or anything? please tell me I'm so worried
ساينل بوني سيقنال بوني i must let you know     JYP
hori sht. for a second, I can't find Ji hyo omg anyways she's been my bias since sixteen :) AND I prefer long straight black hair for her more! She's so pretty before, but even now. I often talk about my sister how for us, in Twice, Ji Hyo's the prettiest. I mean they are all pretty but Jihyo, i don't even know what to say. plus her voice is the kind of voice that I really love \u003c3     ps. Momo, can you please stop seducing me? u makin me have twice's gayness
who tf dislike this vid gosh gth who dislike this vid 😡
I love it how Momo had less than 10 lines in Knock Knock and not being in the middle for once as a main dancer. But now look at her. \u003c3
Still not liking the song too much, but this is one of their best choreographic in my opinion. They upped the intensity a bit, which you can really see if you rewatch all their other dance videos. I didn't realize that they tended to be pretty low in intensity and that mostly due to their title songs tended to how a pretty chill tempo, which I didn't notice at first. You can also tell the intensity went up because you can here a few of them breathing heavily at the end of the video. It's good. They needed to do that eventually and I'm sure the dancers in the group were happy to get a more challenging choreography. It's not crazy like say a Red Velvet choreography, but still really good. They should continue that in the future.
I think this song is good. Why people say it's not good ?
yes why? this is song is very good though
maybe it's their taste
Mayu eiei Because it's their opinion?
Im not a fan but tbh, i like the song.. especially the choreo  #pinkpanda here to support..
damnn healthy thighs.  good thing JYP doesnt starve  them
Momo looks so happy when she dances❤️ I bet she fall in love with this choreo
am i the only one who loves the song? ;-;
I have to say this song is not bad
the first time i saw the mv. Gotta be honest,the song is not my favorite and that creepy ass alien didn't help  But the song is stuck in my head...... and after seeing this choreo , i must say. I love it
i like TWICE but i don't like ONCE. some of them are immature fans that's always compare TWICE with another Girl Group. and said TWICE are the best and other stuff. please be understanding, another gg is human too. they will be hurt as your idol get hurt. i just say this to immature ONCE. TWICE Hwaiting!
Nayeon is working really hard. I think she gets really tired whenever they dance signal look @ 3:22 she's breathing really hard (Even the other members). Anyway, I think its really a nice song. It's just that the MV is errrr really weird (this only my opinion) .
they're like SNSD , I dont like 😆😆😆
Lia Kim didn't choreo this ryt?
0.29 that so rude of you tzuyu
This song is awesome but I have a questions for ONCEs, what are the best TWICE ships?
sana momo and tzuyu make my world move i never loved someone sm
i super love Jungyeon's Presence ;) 💓
why did the footsteps sound annoying?
Jungyeon's legs are brighter than my future
The girl with white shirt and rip jean is so gorgeous
I always see that  Sana momo mina tzuyu are dance line and in the last part They look great and beautiful
There's something about Dahyun this time. Her attractiveness is starting to change from cute to sexy.
Nayeon is panting at the end :( still cute tho.  Sana is so gorg.  Momo is really enjoying.  Good to see Jihyo dancing again, I'm worried about her knees.
My Queen is slayyyyyyying in this dance practice. Jihyo I love you #DayOneFan
Wow more than 2mill in less than 24hrs👏🏼 can't wait to see all the dance covers :D
Im glad that they gave jihyo more recognition
Everyone's like: jihyo jihyo jihyo (no hate I love her too)And I'm like: Dahyun's fashion is so me, she's so gorg (my bias tho)
they sould stop playing with hitting head. even it just using a plastic hammer or what, they hit too hard on the head of idols.
Of course, hitting very hard on the head is really not good. They are men, they hit a woman's head. For whatever reason, I think they should stop doing it. That was so scary to watch.
Front Desk @detikcom You watched Weekly Idols? They said it is for the effect of programme. To make it more entertaining....But I don't agree with them.
I freaking love this comeback!!!  i love the song, it's addicting and the choreography is awesome!!!  For me, this is their best choreography so far! All of their choreos are awesome too though but this is the best!
Why does JYP insists on not fixing the audio on the Dance Practice videos? I really liked the choreo, but it startled me to hear the tapping on the floor. Good song, it grows on you.
i think nayeon try to plagiatzz taeyeon from her clothes
when I first saw the mv I thought I didn't like this song  but I realized I liked the song and dance just not the actual mv
The sounds in this dance practice are so satisfying
those 12k dislikes tried to dance this but failed
They're talented and hardworking, beautiful inside and outside.  Once, please protect them form anti who want drag them down.  I promise I will support them 4ever.
I know people will backlash me a lot, but this is probably the first Twice song since Ooh Ahh Hage that I actually enjoy listening. It has such a different vibe and the style is so good. I don't know why people are being so mean to this comeback.
Chaechae slays in this suit!
i prefer the dance version than the mv.
Really love SANA'S fashion
army here supporting twice😊 btw my bias is tzuyu and bias wrecker is dahyun
Finally. Everyone noticed my Jihyooo😍😘 Shes totally a bias wrecker. Omo dahyun-ah, jihyo is a Purely Goddess 😘😘😘😘 Their comeback was the hardest choreo yet most catchy song. Fighting! ArmyXOnce Forever 💝💝💝
I feel sooo lazy to learn this dance hahha
Their choreography here is so cute and i think its the best choreography than before :)   Now, i stan the right group :)  No hates, I'm Multifandom 😁
I know all of them are wearing pants (except jeongyeon), but d***, SANA in those pants is really sexy and hot. And is it only me or the dance really suits SANA and MOMOring ~~? They are really a great dancer. 😍😍    #noSANAnoLIFE
90% About Jihyo   9% About Momo  1% About others   =P
listen to this song again and again you'll love it,It will stuck in your head 😍don't care people who dislike it because I'm really really in love with this song 😍
Twice babies, love u so much!!
Is it me or chaeyoung looks like ehuna from gfriend
Omgg their steps are cooool ^___^
SIGNEU BONAE SHIGNAL BONAE~ Twice songs are very catchy 😍
My girl MOMO is killing it , she is so energetic I love it ❤️
god this is a epic dance omg i think i practice this a year or 2 ahh i hate hard core but im trying my best to practice this fighting to myself!
They stepped up their choreo i'm so happy- and i actually like Signal ; ;
I cant get enough of this video! 😍😍😍 Song is SO Catchy!!!
I'm a new fan.   Can a good soul tell me who is who??
For this choreo Twice was really hittin it hard which is different from their previous dance practice videos. Their vocals sound tons better in this song especially Tzuyu, Momo, and Sana where they used to always be forced to sing in this uncomfortable cutsey tone from previous producers. They sang in their natural range/tone making them sound stable. I think this time it has to do with JYP himself. When JYP personally decides to produce a song for his artists, he basically overlooks everything from their vocals, line distribution, choreo, and how well they perform it. I must say bravo. He made everyone look good. I'm sure he adjusted some vocal issues with the less vocally gifted in the studio during recording. Seeing how freakin on point and energetic they performed this choreo compared to their previous choreos, I'm sure JYP was also responsible for pushing them further. Like did you see Momo in this? She was giving 100% of her soul. Dahyun? The one who looks awkward half the time she dances? Not anymore. She be killin it in this one.     Based on how JYP was in charge of the Unnies show, he can be very strict and hard to impress only cause he knows they can do better. I fully believe that Twice improved a lot this comeback cause of JYP being directly involved in the process. I feel like he reignited their passion with the pep-talks he loves giving haha And kudos to Twice for rising to the challenge. Like he said 'My artists may not be the best visuals, the best singers, or even the best dancers but they are the best workers and no one can beat them when it comes to their dedication and determination.'
the way he trained i.o.i also explained a lot about how he is very detailed in every component possible
Kassand R. Yea, His adjustment amplified all of their ability 100% and makes me satisified. Frankly say, titles' distribution rather inclined to vocal talented members beforehand. But this song induce their latent talent get away out of stereotype.
I'm jihyo lovers...  I like you jihyo ^-^  From = 아이샤 and 유숩
mina is pretty as usual; but jihyo ,   OMG !! since signal you are amazing;you r a bias wrecker!!
All this Jihyo love 😭😭😭
I cried, they're all so beautiful, Momo got off
dahyun seemed a little down here my babyy :( I LOVE YOU!! YOU'RE DOING GREAT SWEETIE!! YOU'RE AMAZING!!!!!
they look so beautifull
Can anyone tell me what brand their white shoes are?
I'm jihyo lovers...  I like you jihyo
my baby Jihyo is getting so much love waaahhhh.  my bias since sixteen 😘😘 twice fighting!
Why do they get so much hate on this song This is now my favorite song from TWICE
omg, jungyeon!!!! can we talk about how perfect this choreo for her? can't take my eyes of her!   please give jungyeon more love! ^^     #jungyoenhardcorefans
omayghad look how hot Momo is😍😍😍😍
Whoah! Most of the comments are all about Jihyo 💕 I love how people appriciate her now but don't sleep on other members ☺️ They deserve all the love 😊 Fighting Twice! 💕Sml
Look at the like/dislike ratio, it just prove that this song is better with their dance.
jihyo is such a fucking pretty,i cant!!!!she's my bias wrecker in twice
All these jihyo comments I'm emotional 😭 get that recognition you deserve my baby 💓
same. I'm not even ONCE but Jihyo wreck all my girl bias. She's too pretty. The first TWICE's song i encountered was Cheer Up and I couldn't take my eyes off Jihyo.
bias from the start ♡ Jihyo ♡
Momo deserves more spotlight on Twice's dances, she's amazing but underutilized!
Koreans like twice so much but some international fans hate them like who cares they will slay everything despite all the hate they received
where is Momo stans? she is so gorgeous
This choreography is cute and sexy at the samw time and i love it
Who's the one with long straight black hair 😍 ?
wahhh their dance is LIT🔥🔥🔥  😍😍😍😍😍
i love jihyo and nayeon part....
the sound of their shoes hitting the ground is so satisfying
Baby Jihyo fighting 😭😘  I don't know why Sana and Dahuyn looks sexy in here 😂😂
Jihyo and Nayeon always got the catchiest part be it chorus or not
Catchy parts for me:  Like ooh ahh:  Momo's dance break and the chorus     Cheer up:  Chorus    TT:  Sana's part and the TT part    Knock knock:  Every knocking part    Signal:  Dahyun and Chaeyoungs part +the chorus.
JK_ARMY VIP otaku you are so rude
Daniel Guerrero I agree thx for making my explanation clear
'except momo cz she's a dancer' Really? Then what the fuck is she doing when her parts come in? she just speaking with rhythm?    Yeah, she's the main dancer but she CAN also sing, her voice may not be the strongest out there, but hey, she's singing, maybe out of pitch or out of breath but she sings, don't say an idol can't sing just because he or she isn't the most powerful vocalist in their group, specially when their possition in the group is not related to vocals.
박쿄신 jihyo and nayeon are the best vocalist in twice but also other members can sing expect momo cz she's dancer
The sound of their feet stomping to the beat is just SO SATISFYING
I love Sana so much
I like how this dance is more challenging than the rest. I think if they keep improving like this they could be even more great idols.
Nayeon's outfit every dance practices are very very catchy
idk, the dance makes me like it more than i already do damn 😩👌
Momo's movement are complicated. i love her dancing skills
This dance is seriously amazing it must be one of my favorite idol group choreographies
Props to dahyun and sana for maintaining eye contact with the camera throughout the entire video. Like when they're looking up, it feels like they're looking right at you. (and yah i watched this like 10 times, focusing on a diff member each time. I'm pretty sure they the only ones who do it for most of the vid)
jihyo is wrecking my bias list
This choreography is my fav among all of it. :D \u003c3  Momo seems to like this choreography very much.
The formation changes!!!! Honestly how???? This is awesome!
This dance alone already made me doubt my bias list
Black hair Jihyo is goals , she reminds me of Citrus Mei
0:52 Momo's got that extra pop I LOVE IT!
I love that they have Tzuyu twirling around in the background during the intro
momo is legit body goals we love a thicc queen!
I've always wanted Jihyo to get the attention she deserved and look at god! 😇😇😇
nayeon's part is my favorite XDDDD  momo and sana killing it doe!!!
had to rewatch 9 times since they're all FLAWLESSSS
I still can't get over Nayeon not starting the song! My bias usually sings first! But I love this song and choreography!  
finally the sofa is gone!😂
they sa that this song is so weird but i'll give them GOLDEN BAZAAR☺☺😊😊😊😊
Idk why, but i think mina and the girl with short hair and long pants lacking with dancing.. its very obvious.. especially when you look into momo or the other girl..
Tiara Evalda Mina is the lead dancer tho
Momo looks like she's having a blast. She went ham on this dance. I feel like Twice loves the dance even if they've low-key indicated the song was chosen against their will LOL
I love jihyo 😭😭😭😭😭😭
There's more ayego then the amount of good grades I have.
I think the dislikes are from thrice. Haaaays. Haters gonna hate
tzuyu in the beginning tho \u003e\u003c
Thrices are shaking 😂
Where is the 4K option JYP? :(
I must learn this dance 😂
why are all the comments about jihyo? I mean look at how long jungyeong hair has grown
This is definitely Jihyo's era 🔥😍, she has always been beautiful but there is no denying that she is shining even more in this comeback ☺️
Joon Bug Definitely! She's the first member aside from Momo to have truly grown into her womanhood. You got glimpses of Nayeon and Sana in TT, and Jungyeon in Knock Knock but not really. She has this new confident glow that hasn't always been there. I'm so loving it.
this dance belongs to momo, it's really suit momo's dancing style.
Jihyo my babe
anyone noticed jungyeon legs was same colour as floor and wall and it looked like her legs was invisible
FUCK this vid makes me gay for chaeyeon
I like looking TWICE performing, I don't why but when I watch them performing, I feel like is a *BOP*
The next person who dislikes this is gunna get their dick cut off by me :)
literally can't take my eyes off jihyo, god she's so gorgeous
This is not hating on Twice's dance practice, but to be honest the footsteps sounds so annoying.
I love it
them jazz squares
Tzuyu biased, but I can't take my eyes off Momo. She's so swaggy
Who is the girl with short grey t-shirt? The shortest hair.
momo is amazing i love her so much ♥♥♥
Can't stop staring at Momo! Her dance skills are amazing!
I must admit I didn't like this song at first but now it's caught in my head. *sings nareul wonhae signal ponhae*
Anyone know where to find that sweater Sana wore?
im crying ryt now. from ooh ahh to signal ugh my babies are old but pretty 😭😭❤❤❤❤❤
Mhhmm...when the dance movement for Wae 2:30-2:35 is...not bad...but not really though through like I usually see in their dance movements...maybe it's just me?
my first bias Jihyo Slays ❤❤❤❤ and my Tzuyu so tall ugh my babies. ❤💕❤❤❤❤❤
I don't actually like this song when  I see the mv but now with just dance,the mood is lit,love all of you twice😍😍
I'm happpy because 70% of this comment section has Jihyo with TWICE in it😍🙏
chaeyoung I like the way you dance here. effortless but swag.
Sana is looking so gorgeous! Lots of love to her
JIHYO rise to the sky!!!
black hair mina is my religion.
eye contact please...  love u mina!!!
I honestly don't know why this song has struck such a negative chord with they public. I love the song, it's not the same sounding churned out crap other groups are constantly pedalling. The dance is very cute and I think the video is cute too. I'm honestly surprised it hasn't hit Daebak yet
imo they all look the best they've ever looked (tho i think cy needs to fully commit and cut her hair even shorter like ambers) overall their styling seems rly good this era so far and im so glad momo got to cut and darken her hair~
This is what I was expecting Twice to be after they debuted. The choreography for Ooh Ahh was very energetic & had lots of complex formations. Every comeback after that, I was disappointed. The choreographies were just... boring. They were flat compared to their debut. Now, they have a song with complex formations and high energy movements. And not only that, this is their first comeback song that didn't have to 'grow' on me.   Very excited for live stages! Go TWICE!!
So much love for our leader Jihyo!! \u003c3  Finally receiving that Jihyo signal.  Rise Goddess Jihyo.
I'm so happy that jeongyeon and jihyo are finally getting recognition.
im sure jeongyeon doesnt get that much appreciation from jyo especially when she only got 2 lines and the lowest ranking in line distribution
You guys love their song, their talent or love their fame and popularity? be honest to answer. Thanks
Let's all wear pants and not tell Jeongyeon.    Anyhow, this one's actually hard. With the harder than LOA dance and more blocking changes, this is definitely difficult.
i love the choreography..  my sister has already learned the dance
Momo \u003c3 Her dance is wonderful :)) my view always direct to her :))
i like the part dance nayeon❤❤
Personally I stan Jihyo an Jeongyeon since sixteen I always loved their voice and I thought they were really pretty then i watched elegant private life and i loved their personallity(well other memember too but it's these two who brought me into TWICE so...).That's kinda sad that ppl only notice them now
Karim you got me ???????????????????????
this choreo is a little strange looking at first. only because they do it soo..furiously like the stomping and such. I still like the chorus part and the song. just my opinion
eye contact version of this please :D
I can't take my eyes off of Momo \u003c3
Jihyo might be my Top 3! She went up the charts like ZOOM! Momo and Jungyeon did so gOOD aswell! ❤️ Fighting Twice, Fighting Signal! 🤙🏻
Am I the only one who wishes they wear this kind of casual clothes even when performing? 😂
Great to see that JYP listened to the criticism regarding Knock Knock's choreography! This one is much more innovative, smooth and interesting
busy tzuyu at beginning.. to the left to the right to the left 😁😁  .  .  .dun tell jungyeon to using long pant 😂
LMAOing at all the ONCE calling this 'difficult' choreography.     Only by TWICE's standards.
Though many dislikes, at least we get more views. How do these haters get here before me?
can someone tell me who is in the blue plaid shirt?
is it just me or does dahyun look like Irene? eh who cares ILY TWICE😘💖
Mimi's body is sooo.......goals😍  Sana's rocking those hip moves😂👌🏻  Nayeon looks so comfy!!!!😝🤣  Tzuyu slaying that outifit! That's Taehyung's style!!❤️💕  Mina always looks innocent😍😍😍😍😍  Dahyun, WHY SO CUTE!?!?😝😝😝🔥🔥🔥  Jeonghan is the only one showin off her beautiful legs😁🔥  Last but not least.......our adorable Chaeyoung❤️💕
XxLillyTYxX Right?  V comes to my mind too..  He likes girls who looks good with wide/baggy pants
Replloria OMG DID I!? Sorry! Jihyo, the cutest/best leader❤️💕
I know I should focus on their dance but Jeongyeon's legs and her beauty don't allow me😂
O mAY TWicE Jihyo? is that YoU??
SANA!!!! Omg slay queen❤️  Sana stans where are you?  Only me....ok......
So is no one going to mention how amazing Sana looks?
Where are my Chae comments? She look so perfect *-*
Yes yes yes! such fantastic energy!  even tho I didnt LOVE this song at first the girls and the dance makes up for it 😍😍😍
let's do the Signal Sign at the end  and not tell Jeongyeon
1:35 that clap is so in sync! =)
honestly i don't get why so many people like this i think it's catchy ;u;
there are barely any challenging movements in twice's dance. it's basically just 'try to look cute and pretty guys '
They are so cute mygahdddd
is it only me who saw jeongyeon got wrong on 2:31-2:32? but anyways what a good dance 😍😍😍😍😍😍 I received the signal 😍😍😍😍😍
Who's the one in the striped shirt and slightly ripped jeans?
I don't like distribuition of lines...  Jeongyeon i my sorry you no valorize in signal T-T..
Jihyo definitely caught my attention even before all the other comments. I agree! She is shining bright. Love that girl!
My Jihyo is like a glowing star here, finally she's getting sooo much recognition that she really deserves! Fighting my Jihyo ❤
Momo might break her neck tho 😂 Girl be careful. 😂  Your energy can supply electricity to your whole country 😂💖
People!!! there are people other than Jihyo or Tsuyu..  Why don't you appreciate them too if you're a ONCE 😑
Finally y'all are giving jihyo the appreciation she deserves
tzuyu is so beautiful and elegant...  Jihyo and Tzuyu are my favorite.  Twice fighting!
Finally tzuyu gained the killing part, good for you baaeee~~~~
Am I the only one who love to hear their feet all make noise at the same time? 😂
I think the dance is hard
Jihyo I love u
Momo freaking killed this dance.
0:59 When people are in your way but you see a Twice album.
Jihyo is becoming more and more beautiful and Of course all Twice girl's are growing up and becoming more prettier on every comeback and look,They are so talented.
fighting nayeon i can see u have to move to much fighting \u003e.\u003c watch u breath in the end i feel so sad T^T
i love you mina and tzuyu i love
Jihyo my bias why She so cute And Perfect😘
Finally Jihyo is getting the attention she deserves... but damn SHE IS BEAUTIFUL I hope she's taking care of herself
same thought. She deserves every bit! When I see her, I always see her as a precious precious gem but that she's underrated :(
I love jeongyeon bc of her voice and   personality. She dances really well but like she looks kind of aggressive, in which Im not trying to be mean but chill.
OMG They are very sexy baby cute I love Twice forever^^ :|
I love how people don't bash them as much as before, for being 'too cutesy/too girly'. They used to get bashed about wearing things such as badass or too 'sexy' because it doesn't suit their image. Now that I see that some of them even wear ripped jeans and tights, it makes me happy. They're more confident now, their dances aren't as cutesy but it definitely suits them either way. Twice hwaiting!
Sana fulfilled my heart
2:30 look at back, that girl with the shortest hair (forget the name, sorry)..
i feel like this choreography is so... momo, i don't know why but this was made for her
I am addicted to this song
clumsy sana hitting her knee on the ground so hard at the end TT
Normally I would stare at Mina but Nayeon with that shirt tho :(
Would be great to have Twice available on Spotify for South America too.
I love the cheoreography! It's so cute! 😍
i cant stop watching this!!
saida saida yep i'm with you . sana is my favorite member but jihyo is cute .
sana is a great dancer , she is underappreciated
I wasn't expecting such an intense choreography lol. And I feel attacked by all the hearts haha.
really like the team shape ehehehehe
wahhhh!!Jihyo lost her weight!love you Jihyo!!
wow this is hard ;; idont think i will be able to learn this
no actually, like IDK about others, but I already knew that they were good dancers. I mean just look at SIXTEEN and it's proven XD and they were trainees then.. other people and I were mainly mad that they didn't get them a choreography that showed how much they were good at dancing.. I mean, Jihyo trained for 10 years, Momo danced since she was 3.. other members are also really good.. so why not give them a hard choreography to prove and show their skills!! bc if the public know their skills, they will also be really popular not just for their beautiful appearances, catchy songs, etc, but also about their dancing.. that's why I love this choreography so much since I feel like they are now showing more and more of their dance skills. I HOPE THEY GET HARDER ONES AND SHOW THE PUBLIC THEIR SKILLZ
I hope it will have a dance video for only you💕  Love the song so much！
this is the first time I've loved their dance tbh. It's like, it just fits the song so perfectly.
chaeyoung!! her body was like 18 yo hottest girls in girlgrups daymm my baby chaeng you rock that leather pants
im not a fan of twice but im actually a fan of jihyo, she's sooooooooooo pretty and talented!!   and honestly this song is so good, but people keep on throwin hate at that song and jyp. i dont understand why.. maybe bcs of their taste? if you guys don't like it then don't watch it and don't blame on Jyp. Jyp already worked really hard for their artists and u guys still cant stop hating on him, goshh..    but after all, ooh ah and signal are their best song for Me :D
Yall just now noticing Jihyo?? I've never once slept on her beauty andd talent. Slayy them GodJihyoo this is your year💕
all I could look at was Momo😍😍
Sana always have my attention! she's the best dancer here for me and the most beautiful too💘
This is so far their best choreography among all of their title songs 👏👏👏 Good Job JYP, Good Job Uri-Twice
This song & dance fits Jeongyeon so much. I'm trying to look to the other members, but my eyes can't take off to joengyeon's moves.
:D amazing
i love their dance 😍😘😍😘
Was looking at momo the whole fxcking time!!!!
I don't know how anyone feels,  but I fell in love with the choreography.  like ❤💓💕💖💞💝🖤💜💛💚💙💗 everywhere! iv feel this is gonna be when they gonna do unique poses like they did with 'ooh ahh'.     everyone gonna be dancing at all their showcases!
Can't imagine. The type of this video's dance is absolutely different from Twice's ohthers. Good job! Sorry Like ohh ahh, SIGNAL won me!!
chaeyong slays the outfit.
Addicted to this song😍Sign ne bonae, signal bonae~🤙🏻🤙🏻✨✨
Tzuyu is so beautiful this comeback. She looks so tall and elegant.
it somehow seems more like twice when nayeon is in the center lol~_~
For new Onces 💗:  ~ Nayeon is the one with the blue flannel (oldest, lead vocalist, face of the group and Korean)  ~Jungyeon is the one wearing shorts (lead vocalist and Korean)  ~ Momo is the one wearing sportive clothes (main dancer, vocalist, sub rapper and Japanese)  ~ Sana is the one wearing blue jeans and a grey sweater (Vocalist, lead dancer, Japanese and my bias💕)  ~ Jihyo is the one wearing blue jeans and a white sweater (Leader, main vocalist and Korean)  ~ Mina is the one wearing ripped black jeans (Vocalist, lead vocalist and Japanese)  ~ Dahyun is the one wearing a white/yellow shirt with red shoes (lead rapper and Korean)  ~ Chaeyoung is the one wearing leader black pants (main rapper and Korean)  ~ Tzuyu is the one wearing a blue blouse and loose pants (maknae, vocalist, lead dancer, visual and Taiwanese)    Welcome to our fandom!! 💗💗
What the difference between main dancer and lead dancer and main vocalist and lead vocalist?
this song is stuck in my head
My bias chaeyoung serving looks 😍😍 bias wrecker jeongyeon got me feeling some sorta way! Lol but seriously this dance is so cool and all the girls are doing amazing this comeback!! ALSO, I dare someone to count all the hearts given in this video ❤️
omg so much love for Jihyo this comeback! Leader era~ Also Momo reeaally looks good doing this choreo \u003c3
agree jihyo looks the best with black hair    momo totally rocks this choreo, sexy cute energetic at the same time ... finally i can see why she is the main dancer
I Love Twice But I can't Seem To remember who is who... can someone tell me who the one With Ripped Light Blue Jeans Is? With The Long Sleeved striped Shirt
wow everybody is cheering for jihyo . she will be super happy about this and will recover faster. 😊
omg i like the chor eo it s the best one since debut
momo was popping hard
Can we appreciate Sana in this? Holy crap she is such a bias wrecker!
Sana's and Momo's moves look so powerful!! I love this choreography 💗 Specially the part when they touch their hair!!
1:50 💓💓💓 (wait i just realized that this emoji sums up the whole song awh cute)
WOW! Great hard choreo Twice. I really love this song!
I love this choreo 💗
I'm new to Twice can someone tell me names? And everything about them....😂❤️
Jihyo is slaying the signal era omg
tbh i like this song than cheer up and knock knock. but TT and like ooh ahh still my fav  😂😂
Can we just acknowledge how much MOMO is killing it? But oh my gosh, just watched the whole thing and they did this so intensely, I hope that makes sense \u003eo\u003c
That beginning caught me off guard haha. I thought the chorus was all cute and stuff, and then you see the opening and thinking, 'Yep, there's TWICE for ya.' hahahaha
LOLOLOL. Ya'll be complaining about the choreography when you can't even dance like that and in sync with 8 other people and look fashionable & not breaking a sweat & not ruining yo makeup & keeping yo wig attached at the same time.
Omg I swear they all slay their outfits
this song is tuck in my head
tzuyu and jihyo look really cute here   especially jihyo i am loving this hair
ikr her hair is gorgeous this era!
They are really stepping up the game with the choreo. They tried so hard on the video and this is just so precious with such an underestimated girl group \u003c3
Im still trying choose my bias between Tzuyu, Dahyun or Jihyo ;;
Welp. Their dance just got a Hella more complicated.
It's very energetic, I love it! I like this song alot \u003c3 \u003c3
I can dance this but with my own choreo. Damn so good.
They are so busy  haha    😂
i cant take my eyes away from momo. she caught my attention the whole time. she is such a graceful dancer. ;) :D
Foreign line in front at the end 💕
There's just something about the choreography that I LOVE SO MUCH!💞
i need to watch 9 times to focus each of them.. they're really beautiful to ignore nine of them..
they have cheerleaders' style 😁
I love their choreography here so much...
No comments about Sana ❤️  then sana in MINE ONLY!!
I love this song and I love them so so so much! They are all so talented! 💗💗💗💗
I cant see de hands because the bright ;-;
The amount of dislike are just ridiculous 😑😑 
this song will be famous for nothing they can't even speak English well enough
at 1:00 look at mina ..she got the hips motion right
Not a fan of twice but got to admit this song and dance would make a good workout 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
WOw TWICE ♥♥♥ They  always got the Unique moves every dance music that they creat They are cute perfect and wonderful twice fighting ♥
jeongyeon wearing shorts during dance practice vids is the cause of my death. hngGgG i love jeongywon really
damn jihyo is the real MVP ..
I love twice ❤️
more lines for Dahyun please 😭😭😭
they are gorgeous .....my Jihyo definitely look fine now....
i love the dance step :*
Sana was getting it too
the dance practice so nice! I like it ! It is best of all their dance practice
Momo is getting it. i love how she such a powerful dancer of the group.
they're all so attractive in their own ways
I'm so happy about the fact that they're getting a more powerful/energetic choreo! I feel like they should show their dancing skills more, they are really talented
Oh no it's the 'Let's all wear____ and not tell _____'!!
was this Choreography done by an intern lmao...
I love this song so more because do the dance that Twice is slaying omg Mina Tzuyu Momo And Jihyo has really caught my eye omg them all lol 😂 😍
i always love jihyo but this comeback i think she is my second bias in Twice after Jeongyeon. 😘😘😘  They look so beautiful.
FUCK I LOVE MOMO SO MUCH. she's literally so talented! I can't even! You can tell she's an amazing dancer!
Tzuyu's the alien here
they're all good dancers but momo literally owns every dance no matter how cutesy it is 😩😩
even their dance is better but the song got more sucks, poor them.
Chaeyoung is the bomb \u003c3
omg this is my favorite choreography of twice ;;
I am speechless I'm in looove with their song 💙💙💙
I really like the dance and the song it's sooo catchy. TT was one of my top faves but Signal took 1st place for me HHAHHAA. Sorry TT♥️
I couldn't take my eyes off of MoMo 😍😍 I think I'm in love 😭
sana might not be my bias but her outfits slay me!! zayum gurlie.
I just realized that this time Nayeon doesn't start the song. Who else noticed that?
this is the best choreography from TWICE in my opinion, SLAY GIRLS
I have to sing that Unnies - Right choreography is harder than this 😂😂😂 The song and rap too 😅    both are catchy and can't get out of my head 
i am really worried about the jihyo's knee surgery , is she ok ?  no problem with those dance moves?
The song is not my favorite from Twice but the dance is so fun and cute!!
Always always going back to Nayeon as the center 👍
all is well, but Mina and Chaeyoung are the least energetic. 😢
Is it just me or is Jihyo becoming prettier and prettier?
SaMo really killing this tho
11years of ballet made Mina a bit stiff on her upper body when she dances sometimes.
This dance might 'seem' easy. But honestly, with all that formation changes? I'm not a fan, but might become one because of this song and man, they seemingly pulled off that dance, good job TWICE.
this is totally Momo's era and I'm so happy!!
Like the twice is the best in the whole world
for me i think this song is really good \u003c3
proud of my bias getting first line:')
omg jihyo is so pretty, she is wrecking my bias list
Wow😲 their hair is still so perfect after messing up their hair choreography. If it was me doing that choreography my hair would look like I just woke up in the morning😂
not many comments on my baby lion chaeyoung ahhhh!!!!😭 my bias😻
This is what happens when you mix certain vocals up from its original line ups... Not bad bad but not pleaseing to the ears well my ears only that little bit of hand chorus sounds good
The choreography SLAYS!!! My favorite routine by them followed by TT.
0.45 - 1.02so good 😍😍😍The agile movements are very beautiful👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
their og t level up! amzing
it's funny how knock knock was such a bop and the dance was ehhhh, and with signal the song is kind of ehhh but the dance is a bop lol (still supporting twice though)
i really really love this song and the dance choreography
Ahh gives me so much of that old wondergirls vibe. So haapppyyyyyy.
Lets do well for signal promotion Twice..be healty always be happy
Is Nayeon okay? She's the only one out of breathe after doing this
bcs she's one of those members who doesnt work out much 😂
i'm in love with this choreo
struggling so hard even in their dance practice video lmao...
this song is awful. the worst
I'm so happy that this comment section is filled with love😄 compared to the MV's comment section, this is far more better. let us continue to shower them with lots and lots of love guys🙆💕💕
I want everything that Sana is wearing ahh she's so cute I'm crying
There's a certain elegance in Mina's beauty. Also, Jihyo and Nayeon looking beautiful as fuck. They've always been pretty but there's a certain glow now...maturity maybe?
I love this choreo of them!
I dont know why the got criticism for this song. I really like it. Dance is really  cute n so is the song
I'm in love with them ,the whole group ❤️
Sana improved so much!! She's dancing with much more power and energy now.
All do the chirin but don't tell Jungyeon
Is it just me or is Mina and Momo super close in most of the choreography? And their matching with their white shirt black pants and white shoes.
I think this is my least favorite title track of theirs, but my favorite choreography yet. 😂💕  And Jihyo's so beautiful, I'm crying.
Yeah, Jihyo's hair looks really good I love the color
I love this song so much! I'm happy that they decided to go with more complex choreo this time since the dance line shines so much and get so show their skills. I get that they used more simple choreo so everyone could learn the dance easily but the dance this time has so much energy and sass  Edit: my fourth time and my eyes getting drawn to Jihyo And the J- trinity.... They were already pretty high on my bias list but that's changed now😆
i deadass thought momo's leg was about to fly off at 0:57-0:58. i laughed so hard, she's so cute, i love her so much lmao.
Jihyo is winning my heart and crawling up my bias list
I love Momo parts
In love with Chaeyoung 😍😍😍😍
On the ending pause, first row TzuMiSaMo💕
this is a good song to dance to i learned the dance in 3 days
Jihyo is my one of my ultimate biaswrecker!     I NEED TO BE LOYAL TO MOMO! 😅
Momo are u trying to kill me?
i love mina and momo's part in intro 😍
Ji Hyo is so attractive 😍 All of the members are beautiful too 😍
I know momo and mina did a great job, but let's appreciate sana's dance here. She looks so good!!
Momo went hard she was slaying
2:38 Poor Tzuyu gotta squat a bit cause she's so tall 😂 same thing with the ending of knock knock. They all move in the end and when the front squats, she does as the same time to be at the same height.
meliodas 80 she is more tired,because she is the tallest
야 인마!!!!! Are you blind? The other three did the same
Momo is more confident than before. And I'm glad to see non-fans are supporting them.
I think it is one of those songs that have to grow on you...
god i love them
y'all momo was feelin herself oh my god
people who say twice cant dance need to see an eye doctor ASAP
I want to see a dance practice video of them running into each other as they try to remember their formation.
this song is REALLY good and the choreo is lit; i'm so in love with them, Jihyo baby so gorgeous you still my fav baby; wow srly the song is stuck in my head
Their choreos are getting better and better. Momo, my bias, bless you. I really enjoy this song and this dance and I hope others grow to as well.
Nayeon's energy during this choreo really caught my eye!
am i the only one who is in love with the choreo?? its just amazing i love my girls
finally a choreography that can showcase momos skills other than the ooh ahh dance break. i really like this choreo. 👌🔥
Eyyy choreo is on point ha this song has truly grown on me! Sana has nothing to fear...
tzuyu my Swag girl :)
The dislikes to the dance video and to the official music video are insane, not to mention their teasers got alot of dislikes too. Why do people dislike Twice so much? They did nothing wrong. What's wrong with people now and days?
Once is a mild fandom compared to its size. People are making up bs excuse to justify their excessive hate towards girls that did nothing to them.
MG i hope they will never stan or like Twice people ( they don't even deserve to be called people bcs they are not human ) people who slutshaming/bodyshaming  hating without fucking reason young girls are seriously the worse i feel sorry for their parents really
I don't understand why people hate on these girls, but sometimes its the immature fans bashing on other fandoms/groups. Which pretty much ALL groups has. I don't like it when people cause fanwars by just bashing each other, I love twice while stanning other groups. Its disappointing to see these kind of things.
i'm sorry but that doens't really justify the hate twice gets, there is really rude people in every fandoms it's not just onces yet other groups don't get neraly as much hate as twice gets. and i don't really recall onces doing projects to mass dislike other groups videos, accuse other idols of selling their bodies, call them whores, sluts, etcs, have an anti hashtag dedicated to slandering other groups, create twitter or ig accounts and make groupchats just to talk shit about about other groups or constantly go to their videos and instagram just to leave hateful comments like other fandoms do to twice. i'm not trying to defend onces who are rude, but the trolls in our fandom are nowhere near as bad as thrices.
I didn't like the song but WOW the choreography is just amazing. Definitely the best they got so far.
Have just read some accusation about Twice choreography plagiarism. IMO, like The Unnies dance teacher said, all dances comes from some basic moves. If everything becomes plagiarism, next time they can't even march or do body-wave without being accused of plagiarism.
This song is a damn masterpiece!! It's a damn bop!! And if You think otherwise?....like if you dead ass think that this song is trash and not the least bit ok?.......maaan something is wrong with your music taste
If you don't like dis song you a basic bih!!! TWICE SLAY ME THANKS!!!! #getoffended 
All this 'If you are a true once'  sht um you should be able to confidently say when twice has a good song or a bad song.  Ya'll can't go on saying that ppl who dont like this song aren't onces lik man people can be independent in their opinons.  It's simply that the person did not like this style.
i really like this choreo!!! Twice be stepping up their game
They really trained hard for this comeback. Sana shouldn't have been worried. Their dancing is so much better!
Probably my favourite TWICE choreo yet
You know you are very popular when people have high expectation at you. So TWICE fighting! Always look for improvement and that's why I love you girls! Don't let people drag you down, strive for greatness! ONCEs are always here.
i love the sound of the steps
Bop of the year
No one gonna talk about how beautiful Jungyeon is, especially in this era ?
I was actually looking at the roof and I'm like...WTF HAPPEND TO THE ROOF
They all are so tall now
This is definitely the hardest Twice choreo so haters can hate but at the end of the day Twice is here to slay
Okay so who's the girl in the gray striped shirt with the blue jeans? She has gorgeous legs
I love this song!!!!!
to be honest when i first heard the teaser i didnt like it bu when i heard the full song i liked the chorus then i kept listening to the song then i loved it \u003c3 since their debut i still dont have 1 bias :D :P my biases ar TZUYU , NAYEON, CHAEYOUNG \u003c3 \u003c3 my bias wrecker since then was DAHYUN & JIHYO \u003c3 i dont get it why they think jihyo was ugly....she has a very beautiful eyes \u003c3 now they think jihyo is beautiful because she lost some weight...that's just absurd!!!  she doesn't have to lose weight to be beautiful!!! she's beautiful since then!! ALL OF THEM!!!\u003c3 \u003c3
Can a ONCE please clear this up for me? Which one is Chaeyoung and which one is Dahyun? I know all the others
i rewatch it 9 times every time to focus on each of the members lol
I like it \u003c3
love their choreo!!! ♡    i think we should also appreciate how healthy their bodies look, I like that JYPE isn't making them wayyyyyy too skinny but just the right amount. Hope they keep staying healthy ^^     & I'm actually starting to like this song haha it's quite catchy ~~
Sana is my life 😍😍 she's cute AF
the choreo is full of jumping.. please i beg of you, DON'T LISTEN TO THE MR REMOVE.     Also Jungyeon looks damn good.
all their dances remind me of penguins
i smhow want to pull that checkered shirt up of nayeon's. .shoulder
I'm so glad Jihyo gets more recognition! When I first saw her I thought she's unreal: people can't have such big eyes. I was more shocked when I found out that she has absolutely natural beauty (I think her eyes were even bigger when she was a kid 😄). I watched Sixteen and fell in love with her 😍😍 Her personality is so sweet ^^ She's kind and funny yet very brave: the leader indeed 🌹 Also her body is extremely attractive (for foreigners like me at least). She has curves. It makes her look so hot. Jihyo really stands out due to her amazing body which rarely can see from a korean girl.   I'm upset many people underestimate Jihyo's vocal talent. She isn't as good as kpop top female vocalists but she's pretty good for her age actually. There're so many kpop female singers who are much older and yet worse than Jihyo in terms of vocal technique (I'd like not to mention them) but people have prejudice about Twice and don't give a chance to them to show their talents 😔
Jihyo has always been my bias ~ her high notes made me fall in love with her!!! 😂👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
i totally agreee thats why my ultimate bias is jihyo from twice debut
MCthulhu M PREACH!! I love jihyo so so much :)))) my bias from the start! \u003c3
Jihyo has always been my top1 bias.   Never changed.   So I totally agree with you~ 😘😍😋
Same. Jihyo has always caught my eye tbh, but I was always wondering why Jihyo was so underrated :( Now that she's getting more recognition, I'm happy for her :)
It was a disappointment, considering that the song was produced by JYP. A hit and miss, but hey everyone needs a blotch in their record.
It's sad that considering it was Twice's record
My favorite song, dance, and everything from TWICE~💓 The small details and the overall excitement of this all is amazing. They've really grown since OOH-AHH. To be honest, even though they didn't start off so great, it really makes me cry when I see how much better they've gotten, and how much they've grown from rookies to real idols.
Momo seems so hyped over the choreo, she seriously killed this dance! 💕💕💕
This is pretty hard Coreo for a twice Coreo but still love it
my gosh Mina si my bias wrecker here
Definitely one of their harder choreographies. I love it when girl groups have more complex dances because they're so much fun to learn! Also Momo went harddd \u003c3 love her
Choreo queens : gfriend ( just daebak )   Visual queens : twice ( all of them )   Vocal queens : red velvet ( really talented )  Rap queens : black pink ( Slay  )  All of them are just slaying my life 😍❤️  I don't know why there are many fanwars   Buddy❤️ReVeluv❤️Blink❤️Once   
i also add dreamcatcher to choreo queens. if you check out their chase me dance practice........you will be amazed and their hard choreo
i'm love this part 1:24
all of them are bias wreckers omg
Chaeyoung and Dahyun so cute, all of them!! \u003c3
twice plagiarized  this dance of lovlez
10k retarded people disliked this.
The more I listen the more I love this song
Chaeyoung is slaying me in this video D: Any other Chaeyoung stans?! UB Jungyeon looking good as always too \u003c3
I used to be a non-fan (and kinda of hater) of Twice, but now I just love them! This songs is amazing and the true onces are here, enjoying this song! \u003c3
This dance looks so difficult! Props to TWICE for learning such a active dance!
who's the one in the leather pants? she's cute
It's hard to dance cute choreograpies and still slay so don't hate and appreciate!!
i love this song , i don't care what other people say....  i love it
bharat gadhvi go to your favorite's mv please.
I am expecting the day when this Dance video have more views than the MV! Prove that it sounds better with the dancing :D Let's do this ONCE xD
I'm obsessed with this song and choreo. This is seriously my FAV comeback from TWICE. They always give 110% to whatever they do!
They all did something to their hair love it also I can't tell how momo anymore can someone tell me ?
Wow! what a choreo! Makes the song even better!!!!
momo and mina part is just so good and there  dance is killing me can't wait for the comeback stage   i love u #mimo 💜
sana, honestly ure not pretty. this commercial of vlive is annoying.
cant keep my eyes off momo as always
Dahyun has improved so much in dance, I'm so proud of my baby. \u003c3  Chaeyoung how can you be so cool? \u003c3
Finally watched 9 times, each for every member, without getting distracted by Momo (that means I watched this like 90 times😂 actually) and I got a feeling while watching Momo (of course), Sana and Mina...   The J-line, The J trinity as many people call them, become a whole different person when they dance. Sharm Mina, Sexy Sana, and Strong Charisma Momo!! ..There is no 'Shy penguin Mina', 'Clumsy doge Sana' and 'Innocent hungry duck Momo' When They Dance.... I just got wrecked and It wasn't Jeongyeon (my bias wrecker)....😍
I'm loving this song!
I like this over the MV lol
waahhhh! amazing choreo!
Wtf the view is exploding, I was here when it had like 100k views. Maybe it is better than M/V lol.
tbh, the song sounds much better when played in stereo, like what you are hearing right now.
Army here to support, I think I'm becoming a once already. I love the choreography, it's one of their best!
HawkKing2000   I know right, it looks like they really worked hard for this choreography and the meaning behind it. Now I have a whole different level of respect for them. Hard work always pays off, TWICE jjang 👍🏼.
L -97 agree! Ang this is so  cute and cool at the same time😻
omg, me too. I'm totally inlove with the song, also.
Loonatic here supporting! That is amazing choreo, especially that opening. It looks just like voice signals passing back and forth through a phone line. People expect only amazing choreo from Twice. Luckily they deliver every time :)
welcome to twiceland!
DUDE Momo is slaying this choreo
how many hearts in total did they do for this dance? 🤔
I WANT CHAEYOUNG'S WARDROBE! ugh shes such a bias wrecker, in the entire video I couldnt stop looking at her, and jeongyeon of course
How can I stop my love for Momo?? Please help TT
WHY IS NO ONE TALKING ABOUT CHAEYOUNG?! Look at her, she looks so perfect in that outfit and her dancing is so impeccably sharp. ONCEs are proud of you Chae!!
all ppl is talking about jihyo, can someone introduce her to me?
The crystal lamp in the BS&T MV Tsang she is in middle at 2:00  she is the leader and main vocals (she is my bias and excuse my english)
LOOOOOOVE the DAAANCE
The intro is so cute my wig packed her bags and left the country
So proud of my tzuyu 👸💜  And Momo is killing it!
wow!!! the girls left me speechless the dance is so strong and fun to watch my fav twice choreography so far.. Tzuyu dances way too good she looks so into it so energetic I've never noticed how good she dances she could be a lead dancer right next to Momo. all of them were so good too especially Mina and Jihyo. my twice babies are slaying as always.
Muni A I think tzuyu is the lead dancer in their group
I'm just excited for live stages later on MCountdown
1:49 my fav paaaart im obssesed
Spot the Foreigner line foreward and Korean line afterwards in the thumbnail... PERFECT LINE-UP!!!!
fighting Twice!!✊✊✊ love you!❤❤❤❤❤
Everytime they're having a new comeback i'm moooore in luv with them   They're just so perfect. It's kind of butthurt ;-;
wow I love this choreo
I love twicer
I actually like the song, and their choreography is so fun
Momo Slays!!!!!!!   I know they need to keep free hands (for all the sign moves, dub finger tutting hand dance), but I sickly need (SO Freaking Bad!!!) them holding porras and doing a cheerleader version! Cause this choreo has a Huge Cheerleader vibe!!!     (I'm not only thankful to jyp pdnim for giving Momo her time to dance and shine!! also for finally saving my ears from Leader-nim's screams!! thank you JYP you are in everything!)   (s/n: I know it looks rude, but I never could stan Jihyo's screams, she has a beautiful voice and she main vocal I know that too, If I consider myself an once, I must support all members so I've been quiet about this stuff during previous cb, now I really need to thank Jyp that's why I say it, and I won't be such as rude again, Twice need all jypnation stans's support!! ...plus she always has lot of lines in the songs, so I think It's okay If she rest a little in this cb👍)
this must be the hardest choreo they did so far .. I really love it and the song too .
I love how hard the girls are getting into this choreo (I notice it most during the prechorus, and especially at 1:18 with Jungyeon). This is probably my favorite choreo from these girls! Twice fighting!
I was missing GodJihyo ❤❤
Beautiful as always 😍 If you are a true Once, you should ALWAYS support and cheer for them. 🤙🤙
The mv it was so terribly but the dance video is so amazing 😉 I like this song ❤️❤️ please give twice too much love and careful faitiiing😻😻
Momo is the real deal. I just couldnt take my eyes off her!
Not fan of twice but I really love this song, the choreo, and everything.   They all look gorgeous so stop talking nonsense....
Everybody is talking about mono and Mina and jihyo what about nayeon she always put so much heart in every dance practice i've watch for them I love u nayeon so much your perfect in every thing
Can we just take a second to appreciate Chaeyoung? Because damn 😍👍
Momo always stands out so much when she dances, love her so much ❤️❤️
Let's all wear pants and not tell Jeongyeon lol they are all cuties!! I love them and get your sh*t momo!
MOMO 🔥🔥🔥 I need a great dance break for her next comeback!!!
when i first heard the song i didn't really like it but after listening to it a few times it's starting to grow on me! plus the choreo is a+
let's all wear jeans and not tell jeongyeon lol .     the choreography is awesome 😲😲 momo burn it OMG
finally about time Jihyo got the recognition she deserves 💞 anyone noticed how she used to have the kneeling positions in the group but in order to protect her knees they changed it for her
Janice Ng yes,I noticed that.In their showcase,they changed LOA and CU position for her too.God Jihyo fighting💪💪
Momo is going hard like she fucking slaying this easy and cute ass choreography I can't with her \u003c3
THE WAY MOMO MOVESSSS \u003c33  she truly is the dancer of the group \u003c3  But everyone else, also did really really well!  I know a lot of people have been saying that this song disappointed them,  but the first time I heard it, I really liked it!  I like how it's different from their other songs!
Is it just me or is the light bright as fuck??
Visuals everywhere 💙
That was so cute omg i just stared at sana the whole time
this is one of the best choreos i've seen \u003c3 blink support once
at first i really don't liked the song but now after a few more listen i really like it thoo😂😂
If youre a once and hates the song, dont dislike or write hateful comment -_- youre suppose to support them even if you dont like their comeback
This choreography is so good. They proved people who said they couldnt dance and were getting easy choreos wrong . proud of my girls!
they deserve a bigger studio.
I dont know why people are hating on twice, this is actually a very nice song!!
i love these song ... 😍😍😍💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Whenever Nayeon sings, the whole group looks like they are spasming and I CAN'T STOP LAUGHING AT IT LOL
jeongyeon kept stumbling i'm worried about her health she looks weak :(
MOMO slays as always! She deserves more time at the center, her dance stands out!
I love Nayeon's look!!! 😍😍😍😍
Being completely honest,  Momo looks so mesmerizing when she dances
That choreo was lit. Best choreo next to Ooh-Ahh. 😍
1:58 love this part of choreo.
This dance is so cute \u003e\u003c💕 I hope I can learn this too
all the choreos have been amazing, but this is definitely the best era in terms of chereo, IMO! 💜
I live for Momo getting to show off her skills, but I wish JYP showcased Sana more. She has very fluid body movements and is a natural dancer as opposed to many others in the group (not throwing shade, just saying.) Momo and Mina are famously known as the dancers in the group while Sana hardly gets recognized. Just wish she could get more dance time.
Lucia R yeah I also noticed that on mina but I think jihyo is better than tzuyu and nayeon tho or even with sana but not quite sure with that 😂
jiminie pabo xxx imo the best dancers after momo are sana tzuyu and nayeon.. people think mina is the best after momo bc she has done ballet for 11 years and always dances with momo, but i think for urban and hip hop dances she's a bit awkward and stiff compared to tzu sana and nayeon. she is the best at lyrical dances tho!!! :)
Also is it just me or are their clothes in here great asf?
didn't like the song but the choreo is catching for sure !
Jihyo looks so beautiful! Also, Momo looks very happy with this choreography! They all look so cuteeee! ♥
No matter which video I'm watching, the only one I can ever pay attention to is Jeongyeon 💕
no wonder i'm fallen for them...  once do^^
is it just me or does this choreographhy seem a bit more sexy? ;) i luv it \u003c3
Their hair alone is magnificent. They whip it and bang their head, sweat and dance and it just flows back to its original style each time
this lit dance practice has 1.5m views in just 12 hours?  wow once are amazing streamers
i like this
When you realized that they made heart with their hands at the beginnings !!
I love Sana and Tzuyu's dance, especially here, they look soo happy and powerful !!
I love them
I learned this dance   Please come to watch my dance vedio
Let's wait for the haters' faces that says Twice can't dance.
I may not stan TWICE but I love their songs and this dance especially :,D
I didn't really like Signal that much when I saw the MV. Watching the full choreography\u200b makes the song enjoyable though. Sooner or later, I might find myself singing to it more than I did with Cheer Up, TT, and KNOCK KNOCK. :)
Okay this is my favourite song from Twice
Jyp is great c:  The dance is cool :3  chirit chirit
Chaeyoung with leather pants im.. dead
Jeogmyeon ad Momo. I send you a Signal because you light up my life. I love you SO MUCH. I'm TT because of Myeon' line
Who's here love when TWICE flapping their hands😍😍. Like in minute 2.32. I just keep repeat it again and again
To 2YEON/NAJEONG, please feed your shippers. thanks
this dance is so adorable \u003e.\u003c!!!!
the dance is getting better
i was staring at momos stomach the whole time its so pretty ;-;
the synchronization of their footsteps is soooooo satisfying :x
im not really a fan  of twice but i like their song. and from the beginning till the end of this video, i am amazed by their beauty. how come each n everyone of them so beautiful like i cannot 😍😍 . and i love this dance . their movements are pretty in sync and sharp 👍👍 . all the best twice !!
im starting to really love twice now, im glad this songs choreo can show off their dancing skills ESPECIALLY MOMO! and for once it doesnt just feel like nayeon/mina's solo, i also really like this song. theyre finally starting to branch off into new genres and concepts while also still being their cute selves
I came expecting hate comments but im so so happy its mostly positive comments.   We have to support our girls!!
Momo looks so hyped 😍😍 she's so hot I can not take it 💕
I love motzu so much.
Wow. Momo dacing in this song ...
and they said The choreo for this comeback will be difficult 😑😒
did lia kim choreograph this too?
I'm die because of Signal's dance. This sí the best girlgroup's dance with me. Tiring ! Tiring ! Tiring! Tiring ! Love Momo's dance and Chaeyoung 's fashion so much !!!! TWICE !!!!! Fighting !!!!!!!!
I freaking love this... Momo looks so happy~
Somehow I feel like Jihyo is the outsider of the group, cause she didn't go to switzerland with them and I never see her on live streams
She don't go on switzerland because she have to rest of his knee injury. ( idk if you know sorry) And me I saw her in Vlive a lot ^^
I need more Dayhun :(
wow.. im surprised this is better than their showcase.. AJU NICEU.. 😊😊😊
i love this choreography, gotta learn it❤
There's a bit Miss A choreo in this song.. 😁
My 4 bias (Chaeyoung, Tzuyu, Sana and Jihyu) slayed this dance and this song. They're so beautiful.
It makes me laugh how people expect hard choreography to a song like this.
I still dont like that much the song maybe if i listen it to more time i would like it but what i really want to say its that this is the best choreography from Twice. Not so easy not to difficult and momo can dance for real how she likes it . I am really happy with the dance.
This song is such a bop, the dance is so fun and they all look so good... IM WEAK ::___::
All eyes on my ult bias y'all! CHAEQUEEN !
CUTEEEEE   I Love them!!!!
autofocus to sana . her dance move so cute 😊
The only thing I don't like about this song is the beginning how they say 'signalburne...blah blah blah' like I get it cuz it sounds 'alienish' but it's so annoying considering the rest is pretty good. Just my opinion lol
i love watching how sana dance. cute and sexy. 😍😍
I tried the 'dapdaphae' part where you bend over and brush your hair while walking around and now i ended up with a slit on my head
The song sounds so much better without the break they put in the music video... Usually breaks don't really mess up the flow so badly, but it definitely did in this case.
Are you all still gonna hate on this song? Just watch this if you did not enjoy the MV at least you will surely enjoy it way more here because of the nice choreo. Anyway, SLAY! I learn this dance in like 20 mins 💜
i wish i have jeongyeon's legs.  love this comeback. ❤️
i love how sana moves. 😍😍
I'm so happy that their dancing has improved, their all great now! (not that they weren't great before but they've improved)  Their dances has become a lot harder than they were and I'm so happy about that! They can now show haters they can dance hard dances!!😂👏💟
Man, this will probably take me a month or so to memorize. 😅 Definitely their trickiest choreo yet. Those leg moves... 😭
They keep getting so close to the mirror, I'm like always scared they run into it. ._.
1.29 my favorite move
Wow... I never knew Sana was THIS GOOD of a dancer
Liz J the holy j-trinity 😂
Park chim chim X she's part of the dance line(Momo,Mina and Sana). Japanese Line!
the choreo makes the song so much more enjoyable. its so good to see my baby Jihyo again, and Momo is KILLING the choreo!!!! they are so good! love me some TWICE!
Sala Sua Yes! Momo slays! I love how she moves! She's becoming a bias wrecker! Nayeon,  I promise to keep you as my #1, but Momo is so extra!
Finally a song where they can show their dancing skills!!!! I mean look at momo she's so good!!!
does anyone know who choreographed this dance its so good
This routine is great, it's the most complex one they've done yet.  All of the routines for their previous headliner songs have been clever and fun, but relatively low on the difficulty scale.  I love seeing them push their dance skills to the next level.
I got SIGNALED TWICE that TWICE's Signal dance video came out.
got the signal and signn
Yes momo baby pop off you dancing legend.
This comeback was made for let Momo, and Tzuyu shine.  Hope next comeback will be better 😀
I really like this dance... is like so fluid and I don't know, hahaha I actually liked a lot this comeback ^-^
can't take my eyes off of MOMO. She's so good at dancing.. Her dancing skills are no joke. Also I'm not just basing it here but from their other performances. She really stands out, for me at least.
hmmm did i the only one thinks that mina and momo more shiny in this song
I love you so much♡♡♡   Twice fighting♥
i like mina's style in here. i think she's look more beautiful.
they have grown so much since sixteen so proud ❤❤❤❤
I'm really sad... Because that will be the first choreography of Twice that I'll not be able to learn. It's very hard!  The best era of Twice! \u003c3
Dahyuuuuun, why so pretty? 💚💙❤
Oh my God Why is Chaeng so cute and tiny, I want to hug her and never let her go! 😍😅
I love them
Am I the only person who thinks that Sana's dance has improved? I'm very happy that JYP is exploring the potential of girls more, I'm sure they have a lot more talent to offer, but so far they've only impressed me!    I LOVE TWICE! ❤️
Luisa Silva the way i see it sana is the best dancer for me here. or i am just being biased bcos she is my most favorite among the rest. but she really dance perfectly in my eyes. 😍😍
My bby Jihyo finally getting the recognition she deserves ❤😓
Her eyes have always remembered me of the eyes of an older boy/girl who you have a crush on, thats why I fell in love with her \u003c3
She already got my attention since they're debut. But I'm very happy to see her gain more recognition, I love her. 😭
Momo'outfit is awesome and simple ,i think with the dance version the song is really really better
who's the one with grey top and short hair? She's perfect
The choreo is so hard!!! Yet they pull it off flawlessly and gracefully.
i kept my eyes on nayeon the whole choreo and everytime I watch this ,i cant help but always pay attention her😂
this choreo sure hard👏👏
I swear Lia Kim be recycling the hell out of choreography
An army supporting Twice! Lets not make fanwars lets support each other ^^     Ps sorry for the wrong grammar
Yaass Momo, 👏 get 👏 it 👏 queen!
The girls are all amazing and I love the choreography! Momo showing why she's the main dancer,  you can really feel her confidence and energy. She goes HARD!!!
Perfectly, I like it)  Twice , we love you so much! ♥
THIS DANCE IS LITTT........I feel like this is the first time twice had good line distribution because all members have equal lines........saranghaeyo twice\u003c3
I hope Jihyo is okay after this coreography :\u003c
Wow! Just watch Momo and appreciate greatness. Best dancer in the new era Girl groups indeed
God damn , the song is so good and enjoyable in the dance practice , the MV got me missing so much in the song
2:22 what were they doing???????? dance is also worst as song.nothig chage my mind for this song👎👎👎
Ella gts  I was here to change my mind but it doesnt so just fuck off !! Is it choreography ?? Even children can dance like this   just go and watch what dance is from blackpink!! waste of time
bharat gadhvi and what are u doing here ????
Dahyun is sooo white 😂 well love this cutie pie
I have faith in twice babies they are gonna make signal a hit fighting my beautiful babies❤💟😍
I'm not the biggest fan of girl groups but Twice.. omg Twice \u003c3
Definitely harder than their previous choreographies.. and they rocked it! LOVE TWICE ❤️
love this
Sana and Chaeyoung are killing it! \u003c3
okay I love this song and the choreo! It's not like another Twice's song, it makes me hate at first but keep me listen and listen more and more! Some said this is Twice's worst comeback but sorry, I think this is the best comeback for Twice, different concept, different style, different line for members! Yeah BEST~
Je suis la seule à adorer la chanson ??? I love Twice!  #ILoveSignalOfTwice  Momo is my bias ! 😍😍
better than the mv
I don't particularly care about Twice, but I really like this song and choreography. I don't know why everyone is complaining, best comeback yet
mina sick now,but she still hard working...once,we have to fighting💪💪
gosh I need to learn this dance, it's so damn good
you know what. This song is not that bad, to be honest. Actually, after replaying it several times, it starts to sound good. And I like the choreography. Their best choreography so far. Twice fighting! don't mind the haters. you guys are awesome.
Shit the choreo looks tiring. They all panting at the end of the video. but over all looks cute and catchy steps. TWICE! fighting. 💪
I'm so glad that Jihyo's legs are fine now😊
She didn't dance with them on Weekly Idol, so I'm not sure that she's completely healed yet.
for a second i thought jeongyeon was going to bang her head against that mirror
should've made them sing while dance practicing. It'll improve their live singing. As i recall that's what 2PM did, right?
now i understand why they said its tiring hahahaa they keep on moving!
their footsteps are so satisfying
im waiting for the 2x speeed . ahh i love it
this is so adorable AAAAWWWWW
For some reason Chaeyoung really caught my eye in this. Actually, they all did eventually XD Each of them are great dancers and very beautiful :)))
who here thinks momo slayed the choreo???
is the choreographer lia kim?
I always love Jihyo and Jungyeon's part
From Jihyo's part i love the hand waves 😁
I love jihyo's part. also momo's
The sound of their shoes tapping is so satisfying😂
they so pale
not an Once but I love this song  congrats to 트와이스 !
'Let's all wear pants and not tell Jeongyeon!'     (If anyone already commented this, I apologize! Credits to you!)
Jeonghyeon keep fighting you'll get more solo lines on a main track till then. Go twice with your awesomeness! 💗💗💗💗
Signal by twice ????? Nah bro it's signal by momo ft her backup dancers (ps I love my girls bless this comeback)
nayeon is no longer the center,??
i adore when hearing their feets sounds . its incredible cause u can see their workteam is daebak !!!
Sana yaaa.. You're going to give me heart attack if you keep shaking that booty ≥3≤
I can't take my eyes off Momo!!! My girl killed it!!!
NO ONE TALKING ABOUT DAHYUN. IM SAD!! ALWAYS 'jihyo is so pretty' ' tzuyu is so gorg' 'sana is so cute' ' Momo is so good' 'nayeon is goddess' You guys should look to the other members, not only Jihyo nayeon momo sana mina tzuyu, There's DAHYUN CHAEYOUNG AND JUNGYEON also. 😔 You dont appriciate their Beauty😒 dont be being biased! and then Always 'momo is very good dancer' Actually momo is not the only good dancer in TWICE, Dahyun also. her moves are always clean. but she didnt show the powerful her yet, but i hope in the next comeback, it will be her Era. Sorry for offending your bias😔
Ikr? It's so hard to find a comment about Dahyun, and actually she got much better at dancing, and of course, she is SO PRETTY
blessed jyp for giving us this twice
Tzuyu is literally like a girl that walked out of anime not just looks wise but her overall vibe and personality, like there's just something so unique about her in everything, her cuteness that comes out every now and then mixed with her little devil side, then shy and quiet side. I hope she keeps gaining popularity, shes a true gem in kpop world \u003c33
chart up sure after promote perfpormance is amazing
well this looks exhausting.
I think that momo always looks the best
i love so much twice
Can we talk about how cute Jeongyeon is this era!? SHE'S SLAYING THE GAME RIGHT NOW. Her and momo are dancing like stars! They all look so happy with this comeback!
tzuyu is so energic my baby
9 dislikes? damn you all THRICES! but anyway thankyou for hardworking to stream their videos
This choreo is so good!! JIHYO is so pretty and energetic:) Also, I love Jihyo's part. This song is so catchy:)
Twice comebacks always make me so happy. Just when I was thinking I need something new and upbeat they arrive ❤️❤️
On weekly Idol, we seen that Jihyo can't dance during the 'random play dance' that prove she is not 100% recovered. I'm glad that jype see that and let her take a break sometimes.
During march, Jihyo have knee's abnormal situation. So she had an opération. She was on a wheelchair and crutches during 2 months. That's why she is sit on the pink car during the 1st part of the mv. Cause they turn the 2nd part when she can walk and dance without problems 
One Momo to rule them all what happened to her?
The song sounded better thanks to the dance performance... I'm appreciating the song now ❤
oh... yeah... sooo hard this choreo
This choreo is much better than Knock Knock . Shut the fuck up all haters who said twice is not talented.
WOAHHH THEIR DANCE HAS REALLY IMPROVED 💖💖💖 I knew these girls would improve, it's sad loads of people hate the song :/
doesnt matter who sings, my eyes are on *momo* idk why😍
people say this easy but wtf I tried to dance to it and I can't even do the hands moves   and believe me I'm a person who usually can dance but it's just this song is hard to learn
at the end,  'hhh..hhh...hhh...' . energetics needs more energy.
I don't know why but i always feel that if you gave them a bad song ... They still make it HIT anyway .. Cause they're TWICE..   Like a model who present clothes ... They are presenting.. something.. to us  I don't like this song at first, but when i saw this performance with that energy they gave... I just Woww!   and now i found that this song is fun and lovely.. (and thanks to the one who created this choreography too)
i love the choreo \u003e\u003c  well, i always love twice's choreo xD  jihyo so pretty, mina so pretty, everybody so pretty \u003e\u003c
such a cute and creative choreo! and the song is addictive too and obviously our girls did amazing and looked stunning ♥
why in every ywice dance video momo is too energetic?
Momo is very good at dancing her moves are sharper
wow....I found the song is actually not bad to listen.....I think it's the problem of MV that I didn't like it at first
don't worry, doesn't matter where you arrive, as long as you're here to support TWICE, you're always a real ONCE \u003c3
So I'm a fake once then?
This choreography just confirmed once again why Momo is the main dancer.
I love the dance for this, super energetic!
I am dying to listen and see  sana's upper clothes fit well with her
What are you doing in beginning tzuyu?? 😑😕
Jihyo.. Tzuyu... ahhh love love love them here ❤❤❤❤❤
This choreography is so energetic that It remembers me of Jelly Jelly's choreo!!
I love both the song and choreography. I don't get why people hate twice so much, they are just every other group that is hard-working hays. Twice fighting! Much love from SONE family :)
i'm so happy to see so many comments about jihyo
me too i love jihyo
Jihyo so small she's lost her weight...   I can't move my eyes from her ♥
the dance during Sana's part of the chorus always makes me smile like an idiot
So the dance is the best thing from the whole comeback
Twice's V formations and hip thrusts are killing me!! Old mother Nayeon is out of breath at the end!! Always giving 100% thats why they get so much love ! 👽 ❤️ 💯 💃💃 💃 💃 💃💃 💃 💃 💃 💯 ❤️👽
THIS IS MOMO'S TIME TO SHINE. and all the girlies look so beautiful I'm sobbing
THE DANCE IS JUST JFBDUNEJDJB; momo really catches my eye while dancing this, how she moves is different and she's so energetic. main dancer indeed
The dance is so amazing and has some nice moves !! Soo proud of my girls \u003c3 #Once
it makes me sad to see how hard they work but people still hate them , they deserve so much love 💖
i really hate twice song in first but i keep singing it and listing it so in the end it became my fav hahahhaha
Let's all wear pants and forget to tell jeongyeon.😂😂
oh my gosh.  jihyo ?!! slayed it . if your gonna compare jihyo from ooh ahh era and this signal era.  she has improved a lot from kind of chubby to a hottiee.  wait I must ask.  who is the leader a d the visual..
Miracle Samantha Jihyo is the leader and Tzuyu is the visual
I don't really care for twice but I actually like this song surprisingly. The verse and chorus is what makes it very catchy. The dance makes it fun too. I would have to say that they definitely stepped it up a notch in choreography for this song.
I'm in love with Jeongyeon
Thomas Qiliang others beautiful too. let me put them in numbers. in my opinion,    1. Jihyo   2. Nayeon  3. Tzuyu  4. Mina  5. Sana  6. Momo  7. Jeongyeon  8. Chaeyoung  9. Dahyun    thats my opinion. whats urs? :)
Malee Hab hooray!! but... what about others ranking? ):
this song suit tzuyu so much
I actually like this Choreo as much as I love Ohh-Ahh. And the song is really good too.
im not really into twice, but i listened to their songs like 10 times already😂😂all of their songs are so addicting. and their dance automatically makes u want to dance too😂
This song great.. And I just want to mention some of you please stop negative comments on instagram PD nim
Jeongyeon looks so beautiful. She killed it  BIAS5Ever
the chorus dance is my favorite   hearts hearts hearts!
jihyo caught my heart
Ik they were hot when they debuted. But idk, it seems like they are getting hotter and hotter each time they comeback with a new song.
Why is no one talking about NAYEON I am dying she is too cute
Their vocals have improved immensely. :) JYP should distribute their lines more often too hahaha. Just my opinion but this dance is probably the most challenging one for them yet. Their dancing seems more dedicated in this one. :)
and song of the year goes to .....twice!
jeongyeon stans anywhere?
2:04 Mina is like 'Okay... where should I go now?'
they need a bigger room
I swear, once they start promoting this in Music shows, people will learn to love it 😂💖 It actually sounds kind of different when it's not the MV (without the forest scene)
hahha I find it funny in the beginning where tzuyu went back and fort hahah I think she did that because she was the tall one hahaa.  imagine if it was dahyun hahah.  it would be very cute for her to reach up the heart from jungyeon and tzuyu
%95 of comments are about Jihyo and Tzuyu
momo,jihyo and tzuyu 99% comment about them.. wow!!!!
thanks for the hardwork girls...although this is not my fav song from them...the choreo still interesting though and i believe this is their hardest choreo yet...
i see taeyeon's dance part of why here hmmm
queens!! time to learn the choreo 💗
What's worse than whitewashing idols? Putting Gingham as a filter.
why tzuyu everytime look so busy in their dance TT also 😂😂😂😂
the lightening is too strong my eyes feel a little uncomfortable, and can't really see their face...
Nayeon thooo *-* 2yeon tbh 😂😂 both beautiful as always!!!
smth is surprising me cuz i thought idol the leg is skinny but when i looking at this practice i was like wat.....
they pant heavily at the end , love em hardworks
to be honest i was so disappointed when i first heard SIGNAL, but now it stuck in my head!!!
i love this song and dance cooool
Honestly, it doesn't look hard for me. For someone like me who is not fond of dancing, I can already memorize the steps of the choreo in my head. Tssss... poor once, if you think that this has a hard choreography, better think twice just like your fave group said haha.
I can dance it. It is the result of memorizing the steps without following it first.
Kim Jerim yes you can memorize it but the question is can you dance it?     and oh, poor? we aren't poor we're awesome, we speak our minds, we know what we like, we know when a dance is awesome, and  we're not pathetic to call out fans 'poor'.
Twice - (adj.) Simply legendary, show stopping, goddesses.                  (n.) A group you should stan.
The choreography suit their song   and make the song wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!!
The m/v this song is #2nd trending in Malaysia. I be like ❤❤❤
they look good with casual clothes
I love how Nayeon's polo is intentionally off her shoulder!!2!2!!2!
MOMO  killed that Dance   Slay dancing Mochine 
This will be my favorite Tzuyu era. Keep it up twice! FIGHTING!~
I must apologize for what I did   I hope onces will forgive me   I was one of those person who hated twice  I thought they have no talent whatsoever but they are so popular   But since knock knock they are proving me wrong   And this comeback they slayed me so hard!  In case if a thrice is reading my comment   Just stop it will you,  It isn't their fault that they are so popular,   And to be honest they are charismatic ladies   I can see right now every reason why once loves them  They are also kind   They don't deserve the hate at all  Just keep those mean words to yourselves   And onces I'm so sorry for what I did   Is it ok that right now I want to also be a once ?
welcome to twiceland...we all are ONCE!
I love you💖💖😍😍
i like how everyone stands out at least once. and. . . their songs are always so catchy. even if you get annoyed at the first time. suddenly you find yourself singing it every now and then. i love their songs even if i don't stan them that much. :)
cool ，l like that😊😊😊😊
It's so cute hearing them out of breath at the end, shows just how hard they work.
me when i saw chaeyeon in this video 'wow i see bambam'
watch until the end of the video  \u003c3 \u003c3
Im gonna say the song has grown on me but the choreography looks messy. The chorus part is kinda nice though.
Jungyeon is wrecking my bias. Huhu. 😍😭💓💖💕
i watched this 9 times
I have to say this is really easy on the eyes 💕👍👍
I love this more than the MV
this is so far the most powerful choreo they have made.. they were losing breathe at the end.
This choreography is so awesome... There are literally hearts everywhere ❤️❤️❤️
Jihyo looks amazing in this comeback @@
This might be the best choreography after LOA and Knock Knock. Can someone tell me if this is the original choreography or the edited version for Jihyo?
without filters???
Aww, cute girls~~ And that's why I love them
I'm obsessed with this song and choreo omg they are so adorable \u003c3 \u003c3  kk~ At 2:30 Jungyeon started doing the tururututtu~ dance part \u003c3
i swear when i hear to this song i cannot help but think of two different tears by wonder girls even the dance also kinda reminiscing but tbh, out of all twice's dance i love this one the most
When Jeongyeon the only one in shorts \u003c3 then Momo still as badass in dancing.   my biases :)💓
1. Them waering white shirts makes me hard to see them, what filter did they use?  2. I like Chaeyoung outfit style the most  3. why nayeon dress like a poor idol, nayeon's outfit is a no no
OMG I love this dance so much!! Listen to how in sync they are!!! Those hand claps scared me! lol
I always don't like twice's songs at first but after a while ... I start hating it even more 😊
guys!! what can i do to have momo's body???? TELL ME!!! 😥😥😥    body goals! ahhhhhh, with just a shirt & tracks on she looks so good. her dancing adds a plus too with the over all look.    #HOW TO BE MOMO?  #HOW TO BE TWICE?
honestly At first i did not liked the song too much but after watching dance practise its became my fav 😭😭❤❤❤
Am I the only one that think Sana's part is the best? I like how the way she shakes her head LoL
Ahh~ Like the song thou~ Specially the hook, It's just lit and addicting AF 😍 But really, The overall song itself is dope 😊 Finally, Got to hear the 'J-Y-P whisper' in a Twice song 😉 JYP finally produced for them 😄 This is just so awesome ☺ Hahaha! Really enjoying this song 😉 Choreography is so cute and adorable thou~ As always 😍  Anyways, JiHyo became 2x prettier thou~ Really, She surely lost a lot of weight, It must have been so hard for her 😭 But don't worry all her efforts are paying off 😄 She looks so so beautiful 😍 Just look at her 😉 All of them are actually ☺ Wish them all the best 😊
I love you Tzuyu!!!😍
commenter30   you can go home now😉
commenter30 i love mina 😍
Jeongyeon as cute as ever \u003c3
I loved this song so much when there was only the MV but with the dance it's even better    PS: jungyeon and jihyo are really  stunning  hope they'll get the recognition they deserve
its funny how i disliked twice until this came out
Jihyo, i love you♡
Dahyun has blended in with the background
this dance video is 100000 x better than clip mv
Momo killed the dance yet again. i can't keep my eyes off her
I'm just gonna say this out loud. BEST CHOREO OUT OF ALL TITLE TRACKS!!!
I love to see Mina in simple casual clothes like this... white t shirt + skinny jean. She looks so cool especially when dancing.
they're so damn beautiful. sana hair is just wonderful
I'm so glazed by Momo's energy, by Mina's movements and by the beauty of Jihyo.
girlxs  ikr   one of my favorite things in momo is her energy
Mina, Sana and Nayeon look so pretty in this dance practice ♥
its cute that at the end pose ' foreign line ' kneel down while the ' korean line ' was standing.
dang, sana has some hips and booty. I didn't know that lol
Erm the style of song is really different compare with their previous song N even their choreography = walk \u003e dance BTW foreign line are so stunning!!!! Just my opinion🙂
ahhh mina is such a playgirl, since michaeng used couple clothes on tt dance practice
Everyone SLAYS!!! Tbh i love this dance coreo better than T.T. Its cute but have those sharp movements which really shows just how talented they are in dancing. ❤❤
don't know how to put it , but the choreography is no doubt by jyp
To be honest children's songs and dances are better than Twice
Ftmglc if you say so 😅
Why is the comment in English  (해석: 왜 죄다 댓글이 영어야)
Chaeyoung's pants are killing me
Is it just me or do mina and momo are extra attractive here? 🤔 they killed the dance! Not the others didn't but my eyes kept on following them even if they were at the back
The Pretty ladies are back😍I'm so in LOVE with BaeJihyo Right now😍😍😍
mimo likes twin in this mv..
Twice can do hard choreo its been proven . Its just that maybe its JYP's decision to go with some easy and catchy steps so that everyone can dance to it .
BTS&YGstan yes maybe gfriend had a lot of hand gestures but their footworks and synchronization are the real thing in their choreography compared to twice :/
'not trying to bring bp down but bp's choreo are not hard' Try doing lisa's footwork in As if its your last.  Literally no girl group has had powerful choreo as blackpink and dreamcatcher and okay clc in this generation of ggs. their choreo is powerful. while twice is maybe complex with hands like gfriend. what a joke of a comment is yours.
Momo so beautiful and Mina   But why always nayeon in the center I think Tzuyu is the most beautiful in twice.
GG-sone-once-rv -meu 'cause why not? y'all she's the face of the group for a reason. :)
GG-sone-once-rv -meu She's in the center because she's the center. Tzuyu is the prettiest, so she's the visual
Malika Hadili its unbelievable nowadays haters even watch dance video  pretend to be shook
Why is this dance so...                  goals
Minna Tiainen it'd be so fun to do the intro choreo😭💔
amazing
I like this Dance because it is not that cutesy they have more in TT and Cheer up dont get me wrong but their dance in here is so good also the song is so Addicting
0:52 love that part  *JUSTICE FOR MOMO'S DANCE BREAK* 😭
This choreo is bravo    👏  0:35～0:53 give me SIXTEEN vibe esp jeongyeon 😍  our maknae is so busy to jump jump jump at the beginning haha  momo rlly enjoy dancing 😍
MiYeon Shin you dont appreciate the cutest best choreo    but act cute at your dp meh😅
Momo literally kicks herself in the butt at 0:57
Pls Chaeng, don't wear pants like that again XD. If I look at you I can go to jail...  EDIT: I forget she turn 18yo the 24 April... so, it's legal...
I like this dance
why jongyeon's legs looks so white ??
Their breathing at the end means they practiced really hard for the choreography and the song itself. So please ONCEs love their song and not hate the song because its below your expectation. Just please
tzuyu is my bias. but momo's dance is really slay me ..she is so amazing... twice fighting..
As expected, momo is amazing 👍 dancing mohchineee
lol imagine Tzuyu doing the beginning by herself tho 😂
GUYS!  I KNOW other Once can agree with me, seeing them dance with this much complexity and speed (in comparison to their other dance practices, not the main dancers in Kpop) I'm REALLY IMPRESSED! It's a 10/10 from me, just my opinion 👍    Edit: Forgot to mention this only makes me love the song more. Can't wait for more Live Performances!
I love everyone but momo is in another level in this video 😍
i love the dance more than the song .3.
This choreography is so intense compared to the other ones. They're so great
Are people really loving Momo's dancing? Bc watched her the whole vid and just got annoyed. The way she dances is too much, it's just too forceful. Idk i've noticed this since TT, it feels like she tries too much to dance better than the other members.
Tinay somehow, i think the dance is way too easy for momo, thats why she stands out, her moves are just so clean and sharp compare to others. it doesn't bother me that much, tbh. ☺
Tinay Nope, She is actually holding back. She just dance like that, But the truth is she is holding back. She wants to be equal with the other members, But when she dances she just does it perfectly and effortlessly.
the 3x3 square dance is my favorite part ! And Tzuyu finally gets centered in the main chorus, really happy about it 😍😍😍
'twice are flops' -others    ohh they mispelled the word SUCCESS.. to be honest at first the is weird, but when I watched this.. OHHHHH I LOVE IT
Lets see their live perf in the future
You can just hear nayeon in the end breathing heavily aww bless her 😍❤️
Jihyo wrecking my bias list~!♡
They are beautiful twice I adore them I love momo and jihyo they are the best they are the most beautiful they never change they always follow for the future they do not pay attention to the q they say they do not have talent for something they are ahy😚😚😚😚😚
MY GIRLS DID THAT!!! Did yall see my girl Jeongyeon killing it?!
Is it just me that the dance room is small? Like , What im trying to say is that if you have a big group its makes the dance room smaller. I still find this song cute.
Jihyo is the most precious girl ever, she is everything to me
Lets all wear pants and don't tell to Jeongyeon
well this is much more better than  the MV at least it shows me how much they had improved. I'm not a hater and not once.Tbh they did improved but their live is still not consider as stable if you compared them with other girl groups ...I am not going to judge them based on other opinions so let's see how far they will go and sure I will try to listen or like their songs. Btw seems like Jyp start to let other members got more line in the song what a great thing. Wish to see more great songs from twice. Twice fighting!
garbage.... when u depend on ur face and stupid gag auego to sell music... twice is utter disgrace of kpop
Safayat's TexArt Aww, Poor you. Sorry to break your bubble but Your opinion doesnt affect them nor they won't notice it. *Lol* Keep barking
I really want to know what kind of the jeans that Nayeon wore? It's so cute
more like tip tap version lol love it tho
I can't take my eyes off jiho she is beautiful I swear ❤️
Sana Nayeon Mina Just Rocked the floor...They are good at any choreography! Love U Triplets...TWICE Fighting! !
this is so cutwe
I dont know why some people dislike the choreography saying that it was the HARDEST choreography in a sarcastic way. The choreo actually deserves a lot of Love. ❤❤❤
Jihyo's knees looks still not very well, so that JYP designed her dance part more careful.
i didn't like the song with the mv but it sounds really really better with performance somehow.
I'm not their fan but this song is really gooddddd!!! this song is stuck in my head and the choreography is so cuteee!!
INFIRES MENN YEAHHH Hope you join the fandom. ♡
IM SORRY BUT CHAEYOUNG LOOKS CREEPY.  i just saw her bobbed hair and that red lipstick. that pants looks weird tho. im sorry chaeyoung but ur too overdressed
Okay I didn't like it at first listen but listening to this for the second time and watching this dance practice actually got me addicted 😂
Wan Ameera so true with me lol I didn't like at first but now... I think I saw the MV for more than 10 times...
not sure why you're taking this comment so literally but ok
Not sure if you know what popping is but ok
chaeyoung and her tight pants had me shOoKt
nayeon looks cool in that outfit 💕
I have to admit, Jeongyeon looks beautiful with bob hairstyle
Even though the song didnt live up to expectations, there's no senying it, the choreo is really good
just don't forget to stream the MV too guys .. #ONCE #OneInAMillion
i love this dance so much!!!!
am i the only one who tries to focus on my bias but keeps on getting distracted by jeongyeon's legs or... ;-;
I still can't decide if I like this song or not, but I do like the dance!! 🙂
Jihyo looks so pretty with her hair like this!
I'm happy Momo has a chance to show of her skills. This is why JYP choose her.
Imagine if Somi was able to get in to twice, Visual explosion
It looks really bad. No synro at all. I am new to Kpop and this is one of the worst Dance Practises i have seen. But the girls were pretty cute. And i liked the song that was playing. I will definitly check out the song soon. But there was one girl that caught my attention. In my eyes she was the only one that could actually dance really good. Whats her name? She was waering a Tshirt that is only white and she has brown almost black hair.
ONCE my family TWICE my life I already know some names. and this coreo isnt hard at all but some didnt  even finish the move and moved to the other one. it looks really lazy and as if they can dance. And i was only comparing the dancing nothing more. They are already in top5 of my favourite gg.
noxchi A Every girl group is different. Not even all members in a group can dance at the same level. Some are more experienced, for example Momo. That doesn't mean they can't dance though. They definitely have dance skills that most of us don't even measure up to. It's not easy to pull through any choreography just like that. It takes them hard work and lots of practice. But still thank you for your opinion. I hope you are able to check them out more and become a hardcore fan😉
ONCE my family TWICE my life i checked them out. they really cant dance well. Of course they are dancing good but you cant compare them to other gg. But i really like their songs and they are pretty cute. But i hope they will improve their dancimg even more
noxchi A Her name is MOMO. She is TWICE's main dancer. Check more of their dance practice videos, you will fall in love with them! 😉
love jihyo's way of dancing, it's powerful yet cute at the same time
Jyp ''momo'' the best one of twice
The best part about this is their outfits tbqh
Satansoo I know right! She looks so beautiful here plus she is a pretty good dancer
So cute 😭😭 Jeongyeon looking more girly..Tzuyu looking more beautiful and grown up to fast 😭😭 Momo daebak 💕 all of them so talentad love yall
I'm a SONE and ONCE . Omg they surely will replaced their sunbaenim our soshi . Twice Fighting !!! ✊🏻
?what's her name 0:43 girl with short hair in the middle
Their breathe at the end of the vid tho 😍
THIS DANCE IS SO FREAKING CUTE !! And all of them look so cute  as well :D  But like what I've noticed is that Dahyun does tend to be less energetic in certain parts when dancing compared to the other members, like Momo for example. This isn't hating on Dahyun, I just think maybe they'd look a little more synced (they're already in really good synchronisation, don't get me wrong lol) if maybe her energy when dancing was consistent. They're all improving so much though ! ❤️ fighting twice !!
Inlove with jihyo 😭❤
I love Tzuyu's style 😍😍
Where's the love for Dubu Queen Dahyun!?!? ❤
Momoring!!! Can you be any more shining and perfect!! Truly a happy joyful angel when doing what she's most passionate about: Dancing. Keep slaying Queen!! ❤💜
Why does it look like they over-dance?
I have a great idea. When you see rude and insulting comments instead of fighting just say 'Dahyun will pray for you.' those btches will surely shut their asses up. :)
For those Korean Onces out there: I hope atleast 50% of your comments are positives 😁😁 And let them win on Inkigayo (And other music shows) You're our only hope considering that we can't support twice when they perform in these kinds of things 😂
Sooo no one's gonna talk about how good Chaeng looks here? :x
i like twice😻 and my friend dont trust me!🙁 i like all of this song is related to !e😂😂😂
WOW! Great dance! MoMo is my sunshine!!! I think the dance is save the song!!! The song became so amazing!!!!
OMG MOMO!! When you can't stop looking at her!!😱❤
they are all pretty but am i the only one who thinks Jeongyeon is the prettiest?
i hope that twice members could atleast reach momo's energy in dancing. because it seems like momo is the only one who enjoys dancing while the other members are not giving their all, or maybe momo was just really powerful that she couldnt control herself anymore. i dont know it really shows that the energy is not balance. momo is always overpowering her members eventhough it is not her part
Tbh, this was the only one that their choreo is difficult to dance
I love twice♥  Really the dance is beautiful♥
No wonder Momo is the main dancer while Mina is the lead. their dance.... wowwww proud of dance line #MiMo
TWBPG7 ./  The Main dancer is Momo and then the Lead dancers are Sana,Mina and Tzuyu but their dance line is Momo,Dahyun,Chaeyoung and Tzuyu of you watch this it say they are the dance line watch this for the dance line https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwBY2s8B4O8XaE1XdlFIQmx6Nms/view and this  http://kprofiles.com/twice-members-profile/
out there most ppl would say Mina is the second best dancer while some of u think is Sana and some said is Tzuyu, Momo said herself she think the second best dancer is Mina too.   plz stop arguing over this, everyone is holding their own opinion and let's just respect each other ~~~
LOL they have 3 lead dancers Mina, Sana, Tzuyu. Nayeon is lead vocal and Face of the Group or so called center
Jeongyeon's outfil slayed my life \u003c3
I'm the onyl one who missed OOH-AHH? btw the choreo is so lit! 😍
Chaeyoung's really hot with those clothes.
momo. her moves are so cleaaar
Tzuyu and Sana always have the iconic parts 💗 #satzu
Tbh, it wasnt my cup of tea when i first listen to the song. But now, i constantly watched every single performance or video of signal dance, and the song are quite addictive that it gets stuck in my mind during my examination week. Aww poor my mind to handle all the stuff, anyway, its a good and addictive songs!
I am filled with JIHYO FEELS ;; ❤❤❤
they're just good dancers, thats it
uh😅😅😅 v why u don't understand 😳😳😳😶😶😶😍
I like this song💓💓
the type of song that you only gonna liked after 2 days listening~ it happens with me, so
Twice: Lets do the 'signal pose' and not tell jungyeon.   Meanwhile.  ( Jungyeon at 3:22 )
when jeongyeon looked like she was about to knee the mirror with how hard they were going
this is weird but i like it.
Not a once but why are ppl hating on this song... I love it the beat is so dope.. the dance is also really good..
Tbh Momo's dancing is too strong, it overpowers everyone else's. All of her moves are precise and sharp. The others tend to be soft and sometimes execute steps lousily. They need to do something about it. It's not balanced. It's either she tones down or the others should step up.
Momo really fits this dance. You can tell she really likes it.
omg this is such a difficult dance imo LOL it has a much wider variety of moves compared to their previous choreos. its so cool to see them progress like this (since some of us are at the age where we're watching girl groups from their formation now!)
i can't take off my eyes to MOMO!! She's too passionate as always \u003c3 She's too great for me.
that moment when Dahyun still has her powers in the dance practice vid lololol 0:08 - 1:30
I'm in love with tzuyu. She so cutee
I love that intro. haha so many hearts . could be a new group photo trend ?    also this dance looks more tiring than their other dances so far. I think they mentioned this somewhere?
Twice i love you so much❤
momo slays every time she dabces but she OWNED this choreo like a mf! thats my girl :')
thank you for working hard, kids \u003c3  will support you till forever \u003c3
here for pretty dahyun 😍😘
Dahyun looks good with that outfit😍😍
Tzuyu is so busy at the beginning 😂😂😂
theyre so hot am i gay
You can see clearly in this dance practice (and also like ooh-ahh) that momo is a dancing mochine
Omfg Momo and Sana are suuuuuch good dancers Kms they were literally perfect💕💕💕💕 And Nayeon is improving so much!! She's one of then best dancers in this era!!! You go girl!!
Awhh, Nayeon is catching her breath at the end.
Nobody's talking about how hot chaeyoung looks? She doesn't look like a baby here, am I the only one who's loving this?? (Even tho she looks cute af at all times this difference is niccee)
I was little dissapointed because the music is not so cheerful 😢
The dance is pretty cool tho. I see you Sana and Nayeon 😍💕
thanks God..everyone loves jihyo nooww 🙆🙆 rise..jihyoo..rise 😘😘😘
They all look so pretty in this video
im once since sixteen but this song its not good its bad the best song like ohh ahh
kill me again chaeyoung you slay oml.
istg theyre so aesthetic esp chaeyoung + their footsteps are so satisfying.
this song becomes much better after speed x1.5   (also can foresee 2X speed dance in next week's weekly idol)
Liked this song when I saw the choreography. The choreo saved the song.
i never knew why i don't like twice's songs at first but later it's all what i listen to
That's so cu- *CLAP* Oh my gawd, what was that.
this dance is cooooooooooooool
Hearing their in sync footsteps is strangely satisfying
i love this choreography
Wahahhha i like the steps
Jungyeon slays this choreo💕
Momo's dance is so good!!  And I like this song😍😍
Twice love u...😍😍😍😘😘
im not once  i just like jeongyeon, damn i love her  .  .  .  i told you im not once that's why i only talk about her
I love the choreooo 😍😍😍🔥🔥❤❤
Iskuhi Hayrapetyan She's special tho even tho you dress like her you would never look nearly as good
did you see Chaeyoung she looks bomb\u200b af😍😍😍😍
If you can't appreciate the song, appreciate the choreo coz this shit is lit and Momo went hard af
I don't understand why many people people don't like this song. This song is cute and very catchy. Even though I don't stan them, I truly support TWICE and their fandom.
Am i the only one still worried about knees at this point ever since Jihyo's surgery? I'm worried about everyone's knees now...
0:36 when you have lices but still. maintain to be fabulous
l am with you,keep it up
I am definitely not a fan of twice but i like signal at first listen. I dont why someone should hate a song just bcs of the singer. Anyway, Momo really is the main dancer, all of them are good but omygoshhhh momo's moves are insane.    p.s this is my fav choreo of twice except for the jjirit jjirit part of tzuyu but i like the heart one. 😍😍
that move they do before the chorus looks so cool! I love this choreo so much, good luck and congrats to Twice for signal!
I don't know why but I like the sound of their footsteps 😅😅😂
At first when i listened to this song, it was annoying especially at the start and I told myself to never listen to it ever again. However, the song kept repeating in my head and I couldnt help but re-watch it. Now, I am  a fan of this song!😁👍
I love the song and the choreo so much 😍 and Chaeyoung looks so pretty im crying.  TWICE Fighting!!
I made this dance cover! Please, check on my channel!! \u003c3
Finally.. Momo can finally showcase her out-of-this-world dancing skills in one of their songs..... slay 😍😍😍
Let's all wear pants and not tell Jungyeon. Gosh! I'm dying~ Jungyeon is so girly~   The girls were stunning with their visuals plus their amazing talents. Omoo Slay Twice~!
I love how much power these girls have in this dance!!
Who saw this before the original MV?
TWICE members was like: 'Let's all wear long jeans and don't tell Jungyeon.'
this is the best choreo twice for me 😂😂😍
Quantum Azimuth same. it isnt hard like HARD HARD because these steps arent too complex, but this dance definately has steps that require more energy than the previous comebacks and the steps are still harder. plus you can see the members improvement in dancing so i like this dance the most
Dayhun need more lines 😭
Twice so  cuteeeeeee! Beautiful girls and great song : Twice
sound of their footsteps and even clapping are in sync 😍 slayyy af
someone convince me to like twice theyre title songs are bops but im reluctant to get into them why is my life like this
my Dubu is slaying!!! she has gotten sooo much better in Dance!!!!     and they all look soo pretty!!!!!
love these choreo
i cant stop smiling throughout the whole video.. TWICE gives me so much positive energy.. they all brightens my day instantly 💕
I love twice so much and I dont like this song... but the choreography its so good :)
Can We talk About How Beautiful They All are In This Dance Video?
dance version better than the mv... like seriously the mv concept is lame
i love their fashion and omg jihyo looks amazing with that hair
There are some ONCE who dislikes their mv's because they don't like their new song and writing hurtful comments.. All i can say is: You should be protecting TWICE. You should be.. You know that TWICE has many haters.. If you're a true ONCE
+strong power ty op never said you did. 
You don't have to like all songs to be a fan
they are NOT once   HOW FUCKING MUCH IS LEFT FOR YALL TO UNDSERSTAND
this is too cute.  i keep smiling throughout the video and my bias mina  😍😍😍
The light is way too bright to see the moves :3
Sana is coming for my heart 😱😱😱 welp I guess no Sana no life
Wasn't Jihyo injured?  Good to know that she is okay again 💕
With that hair color and outfit, Dahyun can be one with the wall and floor. 😂
I like Singnal's Dance the best out of all the TWICE songs. It's really unique and it's a side I've never seen from TWICE before.  I love how TWICE are improving so much song by song they release. ONCE FOREVER❤️
Sana Momo Tzuyu jeonghyun dance got me❤ Actually all the members are soo good at dancing but those three got me by their dance moves. 💥💚 Momo slaying Tzuyu slaying sana slaying jeongyeon slaying
I dont know, i just always love this part 01:48 - 01:57 Jihyo and Jungyeon their hands move so cute..... 😄😆😳😍😘😱
i hope everyone isn't just noticing jihyo bc she lost weight -- she has always been beautiful and a fierce dancer 🤙
애니 when you have surgery on your leg you tend to lose muscles because you don't move your leg anymore for a long period
just out of curiosity, how exactly does surgery for a leg injury result in weight loss? o.o is it the actual surgery itself?
this song is so different with previous one. this song give different vibe about twice.   i like and love this song too, its catchy 👍👍👍👍
i thought the mv will be superhero themed...
the more I listen,the more addicted I am
Anyone in the centre is automatically a VISUAL OF THE GROUP.
This song n dance is really good. I love it.
the dance is lit🔥🔥🔥🔥
I'm in love with Nayeon and Sana's outfits!!! ♥♥♥
I love the outfit !
If this would be 2x in weekly idol. I cannot imagine their faces😂
I don't understand why other people think this song is a flop. I love it tho. The upbeat especially the choreo. It's lively and finally a fair distribution of lines. ❤💞
I really love this song when i saw thi dance !!!! I wanna dance with them !!! it's so cool for this summer  !!!
best dance? really? are you sure? haha you all are get blind. this is worse than all rookies in they generation.
The best dance among other Twice choreography. Yes that's your opinion, I appreciate it, but can you accept the opinions of others, such as appreciate also. If you do not like the opinions of others, stay away, not like this.
Rossukon Suwan you are free to disagree however if other thinks otherwise then let them and respect their opinion. lol. you live yours they live them.
It was so hard to focus on one member, I tried focusing on my bias Momo but I couldn't keep my eyes of Mina and Jihyo. JYP really out did themselves with this comeback!
momo's dancing really shines even when she is not in the center
I dont like this song. But i love this choreography!!❤
am in love of this choreo, is so well done, and the movements go really good with the song, i really like it more than knock knock, i still love knock knock, but this is soooo good
I just couldn't take my eyes of Chaeyoung because of the leather pants, love this smol kid so much ♥
thanks buddy :)
I LOVE THEM!!! My hobby its to learn K-pop dances. SO I AM READY TO LEARN THIS!!! I AM SO EXCITED!!!
I love this song really💖
ugh i love the song so much. i love the dance so much. i love twice so much. ❤
Momo did so well, but I cant really see her in the center a lot☹️☹️
Jeongyeon needs more love.. She's so talented
this choreo needs much concentration 😂 good job girls!
Jihyo is so cute she looks like a little kid/child.. so adorable 😍😍❤❤
beautiful and talented young ladies of JYP i super love u girls.. i really love the dance steps
Things that will kill humanity: Sana in those jeans, Momo's dancing sass, Jihyo's hair and outfit, Tzuyu's time in the front, and Mina's Visuals😍😍😍
Things that will kill humanity: Sana in those jeans, Momo's dancing sass, Jihyo's hair and outfit, Tzuyu's time in the front, and Mina's Visuals😍😍😍
Every Twice dance video, I am jealous of Sana's hair and clothing. She's so pretty! Definitely my bias-wrecker
the dance is really kind of cool. it looks really good
Momo dancing  are so attractive 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍  just couldn't keep my eyes off of her
cutest intro, hardest choreo so far! I'm proud of twice for having this one! mygash! I smell, song of the year! 😭😭😭👌👌👌👏👏👏😀
_If you don't stan TWICE, you don't really know what KPOP is.._
while watching this, i can't help but worry about jihyo 😥
same:( I really hope the dancing won't hurt her:(
Foreign line got my heart ♡
I really love the dance steps tho😍 but im not really into the song, but twice still slayyyssss😉 fighting~
This dance choreography is really different from there other comeback song. I REALLY LIKE THIS POWERFUL DANCE.     Fr:Pristin fan! Figthing sunbaenmins
the choreography is so hard!!!!! every part of the song is different...and they have different kinds of complicating hand actions everytime...😲🤕😵
I think this song is normal  and choreography is simple that but more harder than others  (Sorry for bad english)
i love nayeon and tzuyu part
Momo looks so happy dancing this choreography finally something that can show her skills. I feel so happy I wanna cry she's so good. I'm telling you...The Momo fancams this era will be straight up fire and I'm not ready for it but I'll gladly be slayed
LOA's break dance is enough to show her skills
true omg she's giving it her all whenever i watch their live performances it's so obvious she's enjoying this choreography omg just imagine if jyp starts giving them a girl concept with badass choreographies she will totally slay it. i like their concepts now but omg just imagine it.
They dance very powerful . I love twice❤
OnCe, ARMY HERE TO SUPPORT \u003c3 those beautiful girls are gorgeous and talented and need to be supported !! We love you \u003c3
Momo killed me with her move nd her body goals ahhhhhh
I just like this song😘💙👍🏻 very addict!!
Nayeon cansada demais também as partes mas difieis vai pra ela e pra momo!!
i think the song is better without the mv xD
Chaengs leathers jeans OMFG RIP ME
love it 😂🔥🔥🔥
Can we take a second to appreciate Tzuyu Sana and Nayeon's dance skills? Mimo are famous of it, but NaSaTzu (actually all 9 girls) can dance so well\u003c3
even jeongyeon and jihyo then chaeyoung and dahyun
I din't know why this song got many hates even some once hates it its good, new, new vibes ts whyyyyyyyy tell me pft
Didnt like signal the 1st time but it grew on me.. especially the chirit part💕💕 I find it so cute😍😍Also Nayeon and Momo slaying as always..  so glad this song got to show Momo's skills in dancing... always felt like their past dances didnt really show how good she is. (except for the dance break of ooh ahh reason why I started liking her) Hope theyll have more choreo to show the others potential too...  Hope Jihyo's knee will get well soon😢😢
This is definitely Jihyo's era! Leader-nim Fighting!! 😍 my Goddess/Visual/Jigglypuff/Queen Jihyo is slaying! 😘😍
Otaku Elle So true! I appreciate that Momoring got a lot of lines this time and she totally slays in rapping even with my bias Mina did well in rapping. MiMo rapping parts slays.
DAHYUN LOOKING SO GOOODD. Well tbh everyone looks amazing, even though I don't really like Signal as a long, the choreography definitely is amazing, and personally is the best out of the dances :)
its really their hardest and best choreo till' now♡
They all killed this dance!! 🙌
where is the sofa though?
like like like !  I like this music.  love Twice ~
Thank goodness Jihyo was alright throughout the video. Got her knees nervous there
nayeon isn't center, tzuyu and sana are :)))
nayeon stamina drop to zero in the end ^^
Jungyeon is so gorgeous! She deserves more lines, seriously.
Mixed thoughts overall but I liked it. The pre chorus is the best part. And it's weird to see such little choreo during the chorus. But if the whole song was danced as intensely as the verses they'd collapse 😂.
Korean Newbie They want people to dance along to the chorus that's why.
I love it twice fighting
Why nobody talk about Chaeyoung? She slays with her red lipstick.
+Dana Steidle I'm also chaeyoung fan..she is amazing
i got yes jam she's so gorgeous! Especially with that hair, she's a total girl crush
I like this choreography 👍👍👍
my dubu dahyun spread love with her bright smile ^^
i got yes jam yass tzuyu always shines the most in our eyes our yoda😂😂
i got yes jam Nah, she just shines for you, that's ok, everyone has their own opinions ^^
Ana Júlia Delgado I understand you. Since Tzuyu is my bias, maybe  I could have treated a little bit biased lmao.
i got yes jam You know, i find this pretty similar with SNSD's case. Yoona never gets that much of lines as the others do, but her popularity and beauty are very recognized by people. But for Hyoyeon, wich really never got to shine more if it wasn't for CMIYC, she doesn't gets lines, center (if there isn't a dance break), nor do people really care about her.  And when it comes to TWICE, same. I think Tzuyu always shine and is the most popular, so that's why i don't really agree with this being her era. She is always the one people notice the most, and the one everyone wants to see. Now, Momo having the 2nd most lines is something for sure new lol because in Knock Knock she didn't even had 1 second in the center even being the main dancer. Tzuyu indeed never gets that much lines, but she is the most popular so that recovers it. But i noticed Momo is not that popular in Korea as she is internationally, so it's cool that they finally focused more on her this time. As for Mina, she has always gotten lots of lines, but being the 1st one is a total success! :)  But it's okay if in your eyes Tzuyu shined the most, i understand :)
3:19 OMG the crash may cause their knees hurt 😱
indeed they are TWICE! i love ALL of them.. im proud im Once! 😁💚💕👏👏 #Signal #Twice #Got7 #JYP
OK... but why does Dahyun look so good?! omg💜
Jihyo is so beautiful 😍😍😍😍 I really really love her 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
I love Twice😘😘 and Twice is beautyful,cute
simple dance but soooo many detailsss that makes it hypnotic
BangTwice JiMina is layf omg i know one hand movement gone wrong and it will mess up the whole thinggg. these poor talented babies♡♡
Oh Leanna It's because the hand movements are so hard. And there are some jumping steps. That's what makes this choreo tiring.
Jihyo has lost so much wait. She's looking the prettiest
the lEGS
Jihyo..... I don't know what to say I love you so muchㅠㅠ
who was watching the whole thing preparing for the amazing roasts coming up XDD
Jungyeon is so damn beautiful as always! 💖
Woo! This is their best choreo so far! Ah, Jihyo. The owner of my heart.
The transformation of the girls made them looked like they came from heaven...I'm in love with them (yes i am a girl)😇😇😍😍😍❤️❤️ especially God Jihyo 
this video is the best thing in my life, they're so precious
Mimo in sync with their outfit. \u003c3 You guys don't even have to say it, we know. :P
love to see tzuyu singing the chorus part. ❤😊  and also sana of course. 👍  #satzu
sana for ever!!!!!!!!!
there so cute and best at dance!!!!!
watched this more than nine times, i focused on every member.
Chaeyoung's pants should be illegal, like really. lol stop trying to be sexy you cute little cub, you'll get a lot of us in jail if you keep at this. Hahahaha
The song seems better with choreograph. I think i like it now 😀
i don't know why I'm just look at momo 😂 . by the way all of you are perfect 😘
is it just me or the song start to grow on me.. and It's actually sounds really nice (^o^)
500k views in 5 hours? so 100k views every hour. that was fast eh.
Mina in casual clothes is life. How can that girl look so good on a simple white tee? I just can't with this Penguin. Elegant AF!
I was trying to dance   but  what the fudge my bones WAS CRACKING HAHHAHA.  . IT'S  very hard to learn this one   THE BEAT WAS FAST that's why.  my Bone.  awwwww!!!
no amount of hearts yall send is gonna make me like this song. not today twice, not today.
I really like them now because their dance now really energic
oh so awesome girls !
woah seriously i really love this song and the dance it pretty cool and hard this time... and if u hear their dance step follow the song rythem👍👍👍👍 good luck twice and once just dont mind about hater 😉😉
I like the steps
No i have eyes shaped of love symbol 😍
they forgot to tell jeongyeon to wear long pants XD
so da like se for BRASIL !!!!
You hear Chaeyoungs Shoes over the whole Song!
i can't believe that y'all still sleep on jeongyeon's talent and beauty, she is lowkey flawless tbh
I keep forgetting to look at the other members instead of just Momo when they're dancing so I have to watch their videos Twice 😂 Momo is amazing at this choreo, primarily because of the detailed movements.
i love Mina's outfit 😍
I love this happy aura they have. Looks like if one of them make eye-contact with another one all of them will laugh.
It's so cool choreography,I love it most out of their past title song.👍🏻😊❤️
Oh my god..... I can't stop watching this... Best Twice's dance practice ever.... lol lol lol💜💜💜💜💜💜💛💛💛💛💛💛💚💚💚💚💚💚💙💙💙💙💙💙❤❤❤❤❤❤💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💜💜💜💜💜💜😗😗😗😗😗😗😙😙😙😙😙😙😘😘😘😘😘😘😚😚😚😚😚😚
I can't take my eyes off of Momo
Yeah... Tzuyu get more line..
Yeah... Tzuyu get more line..
everybody says tzuyu, sana, mina and momo the prettiest in the group, but look at jihyo *o* she is really pretty with dark hair
Not bad🤔, but you can better😉
wow this is so cool.
My eyes keeps diverting back to Dahyun 😍 she's just so captivating to look at! She's really my bias for 3 years now!
jihyo just attracts my attention all the timee ,, she is just so prettyy 😭💛🙆🏻
I love Twice♡♡♡
tbh this song isnt rly their best imo but their choreo is LIT AF
i hate the MV but live performances would be LIT \u003c3   The song grows on you, im addicted now
I love this song
Foreign Line ❤  Eonnie Line ❤  Maknae Line ❤     Love them watching in casual 😍
Momo queen slayyy it!! I can see she enjoy the choreography so much.   And Nayeon did not sing at the start of the song like other songs.
even nayeon is not the center of this songs verse, i still cant take my eyes off her. NATURAL CENTER CONFIRMED. i really like the choreo and happy bcs jyp let other member shine XD
mina & momo centers as fuck ❤
they so cute
Damn, i like this song.
Why this song got alot of negetives respond when it is so good and catchy???🤔  ONCE 4EVER
even the sound of the clapping is synchronize!!
penismegawarhead3000 huh but I did specify her name I just didn't know what's the correct spelling :)
SisChayes FnS I was talking about jungyeon she has short hair
jeongyeon n chaeyoung both have short hair so you gotta specify the hair color LOL, jeongyeon's one is always either silver or blonde while chaeyoung's is always black.
i just realized everyone looks extra pale in this
chaeyoung looks really cute in this outfit
The Choreo is really good.😍I never really was a Twice trash but i'm starting to like them a lot. ReVeluv here to support💗
seeing them catch their breaths after the choreography makes me want to memorize it
I really like the beginning where Tzuyu goes left and right :)
OMG i really really love this choreography \u003c3  they look so good doing it, i love you TWICE \u003c3   (GodJihyo you are the reason of my big smile \u003c3 \u003c3 \u003c3 )
Awwwwww, I really love them They are so adorable 💕
*fighting my jihyo :3*
Is the floor going to break?
Their songs are always so catchy and so cute. The dance moves once again captured the essence of the song completely! Great job TWICE 💕
in every dance practice video,i think is just for fans that always is someone that don't wear same as others.(plus chaeyoung is the most stylish from them)
idk but i just think that the intro of the song where i must let u know part are so annoying i cant
I  Wonder How they Will do 2x Dance😂😂
really love momo's hair with bang 😁
Momo killing me in those pants and simply white tshirt, I cant keep my eyes off her when she dances.❤
I like this new TWICE song 💖
3:23 nayeon heavy breathing lmao i love her so much
Momo😍 slayed this dance😎  Mina😍😘 GORGEOUS 😍😘
Although the music is somewhat difficult to infuse than the songs before, but the effects of this are too great. I am addicted to the movements of this song
Can't wait for all of the upcoming music show performances! They deserve some wins for Signal! Love this song and choreography
2:30 i saw you jungyeon!!!!!! \u003c3
I watched this nine times, focusing my attention in a different member each time, but I couldn't help but stare at Momo even when I was supposed to be watching other members 😅
I love momo
Twice is the bezt ❤❤❤
Why do I always don't like Twice's song at first but like after 2 days later it became my fav
couldn't agree more lol
Is the japan line also the dance line?
There are some questionable dance moves, it doesn't stand out from the other dances they made, but still good
im so proud of you Girls 😭😘😘
I just notice that only Jihyo who doesnt have any kneeling move in this choreo...Hope that her knee not hurt again
twice is the best.the song is good and you had a hard work.always stand by twice.cheer up^_^. love you nayeon\u003e3.加油唷~~
I don't know why I love this song
opss... ok... this is hard choreography of Twice😂
Jihyo with black hair look really good and she look like very slender.
I love this choreography
I don't like this song and dance💔
that looks kinda hard we were dancing all of twice's songs ;-;
Momo dancing is so powerful and outstanding that I cant keep my eyes off her😽
I liked it a lot, it's very entertaining the truth, I do not know why there are so many dislike
jungyeon is so feminine nowadays...she reminds me eunjung of t-ara when I watched this dance video
All that I can say is that I am proud to see this. Why? I've been everywhere, seeing people criticizing them, even I am not a part of the fandom, I feel sad to the comments. Well, Twice, you make me feel proud and ps ReveluV here, supporting all of you!😊😊😊😊💪👏👏👏💗
Chaeyoung is just attractive in this vid and I don't know why
I like all TWICE's song they are all catchy even the dances are catchy that i keep dancing them repeatedly, but I think this one would be my favorite choreography.
Who relized that jeongyeon have a cute mistake :v  or just me who see it ??/        :|
btw.... i still love my bias wrecker (jeongyeon)
Momo's giving me too many signals. She's very great and hyped💞
Is it just me or is Twice choreo much harder now?
Oh my peach momo💓 she stands out
This dance looks far more complicated than, say, TT or Knock Knock! I feel they're starting to experiment and challenge themselves more. Proud of my girlies
This comeback proves how big of a package Momo is.
hello. I love this song and the dance and Twice. okay bye lol
Momo is the one in the center at 0:26
I really like this song!!
At least now no one will complain about the choreo being easy 😒  but i already know if they sound a little out of breath all the haters will come out and say that theyre 'bad' at singing. Yea right as if they are. Theyre above average and its even better since the song suits their voices so much
Nayeon keeps getting my attention😍 such a bias wrecker
Cannot take my eyes away from Sana 💕 Sana is just too attractive
when u have momo in group, 'wait where is she,oooh here she is (the one slaying tho)'
Jihyo looks more and more stunning in each comeback, u go girl\u003c3
TWICE IS my life!! LOVE YOU TWICE!!!
are tzuyu and sana in the chorus part? omg I cant belive this, im so happy:')
Faizal Yusoff because they are the new visual
Dude Jihyo has had a transformation since loosing weight. like she always had a cute face and she was fit in debut. but this girl has worked hard on her body. The weight loss affected her well. Plus the black hair suits her and it's so shiny. 
The dance is cute but looks like the movements are danced in a rushed speed... Makes it hard on the idols to sing lol but now I feel like Twice will be even more tired with this dance.
Haters say Twice is talentless and doesn't know how to sing; when the coreos are easier so they can focus on their vocals they say they don't know how to dance. Haters will always hate; for me this is their best comeback so far and the dance is so cute and with so many unique moves. you can tell they love it, especially Momo who is on FIYAH here. I hope the best for them \u003c3
My beautiful Girls! Completely slayed with the dance!!😍😊 Can't wait to learn it~  Signal 📡👽💗
Lets talk about how great Jihyo looks in this comeback ^.^
facts!!! she out here givin ppl goosebumps and stuff
Damn, she almost break my bias just for her solo screen time on the M/V :')
ELEfäntchen♥ she's slaying it tbh. signal is her era.
YoonseokSeoulFuckYouUp 0:37 she is the central wearing white t-shirt black pants and white shoes sorry my English isn't good .
their footsteps when doing transition give more beat for me 😍
even if momo is at the back,she is reaally shining sooo bright!! 💞💞 Love the choreo 💕💕
Sana i love you sexy💓💓💓✨❤️🤗💞
when I first watch this I though sana mess up at the begin but it was just part of the choreography
Nayeon eonnie  I love you
this was kinda hard
Okay it's a nice dance and definitely harder than the previous comebacks, but I don't see why ONCEs are using the argument that they 'have to be in sync' to further make the dance harder. From what I can see, this isn't any more in sync compared to other groups, nor does the choreo overly rely on teamwork (like VIXX's Error or Voodoo Doll). Is it just more in sync compared to previous dance practices? I don't get it.
they are so beautiful! :) this is why I like Signal! dance and vocal! everything.
Momo really slayed this dance!
i love it😍😍💕
I used to like Twices songs and hate the choreography but now I love the choreography but hate the song.    I still love them though. ❤❤.
Can someone tell me what s the name of the girl with the blue ripped jeans and the brown hair ? ^^
Thank you \u003c3
She totally rocks androgynous clothes.
i like tzuyu's outfit too. she looks different
Joe Andhini I love this outfit too
Tzuyu's outfit is on point, she looks so comfy and chic.
The rappers are the weakest dancersAnd Mono is the crowning jewel of dancers
I waiting this video!!!  Who else??
I really like the song seriously I don't understand y other don't like it after everyone have his own opinion 😬😬
I waiting this!!!
tzuyu, momo, sana and mina omfg \u003c3 (Didn't expect to get so many likes, but damn, twice army are really something....) \u003c3
jeongyeon is such a chic here I love it
dahyun is winning my heart
i always hate their shoes fuck
I saw and thought that their choreography was mixed by boyband and girlband legend. Dear jyp, be creative pls ...
Momo is slaying and   Jihyo looks adorable with black hair^^
Her movements is so on point, my eyes always returned to her even when it's time to watch other members...   😍😍😍
where is the lie tho, and not to forget their hairs stay slick and perfect after messing it in some parts of the choreo smh when will i ever
What's so hard about the dance step tbh LOL
can we talk about how good chaeyoung legs look in her pants....I was look at the whole time 😻😻😻
+HoshiPie bless the mean legs...PAPA BLESSSSS
The weirdest choreography ever but I still love it! Sana is full of energy while dancing this song!
That michigata with hair washing is so cool. And this dance is really well choreographed..
I love you TWICE
I loved the song after 3 listens and i also loveeee the dance😍😍👑🙌
best choreography of them
Chae's outfit is on point❤ I really like their choreographyy💕
my fave cheoreo from twice! and damn my babe Jeongyeon leg goals af like damn😍😍😍 fangirling over her legs
That's the cutest choreography I have seen^^
USER12145 3471544 I have jelly jelly too both of those choreographies are cute~
So i tried dancing this last night......and now i have muscle pain xD
wow their dancing skills are improving every comeback and i love the choreo
They are too thin.. especially Jeongyeon :/
oh WOW their hardest choreography! So proud of them x
They always forget to tell jeongyeon to wear pants 😂😂
why jeongyeon always cakep 😍😍 gak kuku ana 😂😍
Who else is watching for 9 time straight to focus each
thanks to their dance teacher for being too creative
so lets give a big clap to him *clap*
Glennza Gelasius i think JYP who composed the song choreographed it too
Momo is such a great dancer! 🔥 and also, my bias, nayeon unni! Why so pretty? 🙊😍
I've repeated this song over and over again but still I think this song is very horrible and very bad
maulida nurdiana   Thanks for the views.
i'm the only one who liked this song at first listen ? the M/V was soo great i liked the super power concept and OMG they looked all cute and specially Jihyo part it killed the game  and Tzuyu when she smashed him  so Cute that's my Bias
they are definitly not perfect, which is nice since it builds their character and personality into their own person  Sana wouldn't be Sana if she was not clumsy and had some 'over the top' ideas, like in that show when she said to be expert in water taste and that you can differentiate deep sea water by its taste  Tzuyu wouldn't be herself if she wasn't a little bit 'dumb', I mean, if you remember their appearence in weekly idol when she was so surprised when Hani copied her harm rotating 'talent', going as far as saying Hani is really good, you have to be a little bit dumb or at least airhead  in the end not being perfect is always better because it means they can improve themselves, like for example releasing a song in english because some of the members showed good pronunciation during 'Sixteen', like Tzuyu for example
Kaily  true, TT was the most 'mellow' of the 3 but that is to be expected since lyrics focus on that part of the 'storyline'  Ohh-Ahh, I'm looking for someone who can 'lift me off my feet' »» Cheer Up, now that I found you I'm nervous and don't want to ruin it, sorry/cheer up »» TT, goes from saying they are happy to saying they can't express themselves, hence becoming slightly 'mellow' (you don't know how I feel, you're so mean)  still, compared to knock knock TT still carries some of the 'catchiness' and energetic vibe of the first 2, even if only a little
+Armando Rodrigues im gonna disagree with the 'the first 3 singles' part there. i would say it's only the first two. tt was about just as watered down as knock knock, it didn't really have much energy to it at all. unpopular opinion but as a twice fan i didn't care for tt. this one i think is a step up. it sounds more like something off of page 2. but i do still think like ooh ahh/the story begins is the best twice era easily.
That's why you can't understand korean
My babies Chaeyoung and Nayeon slaying as always \u003c3
Jeongyeon's legs is brighter than my future. How is that T.T
amazing careoghraphy❤❤❤❤😱
they should have been a dancer, not an idol lol
You can definitely see who the main dancer is...
I really love the choreography you can tell they put a lot of work into learning it
Nayeon really matches this dance, her moves are so on point 💖 and i love Chaeyoung outfit!
I'm very happy to see Jihyo's knee is ok. ;) but this is hard work.
My eyes go straight to momo she slayed this she just stands out
Tbh their songs are often just Eh to me but when I listen to it again it always grows oN ME
i love JapaneseLines.... \u003c3 Momo, Sana, Mina... i love u so much !!!!! jjirit jjirit jjirit jjirit !!!
this makes me prouder! PROUD TO BE ONCE 🍭🍭🍭🍭🍭🍭🍭🍭🍭    TWICE HWAITIGG!!
I can't take my eyes off from sana :')
I dig this song so much :) #ONCE

the choreography is much harder than the song 😱 im shook
Very like the difference heart dance, seems a female guest attend on running man do the heart dance. Also all the members have the same amount sing.
After seeing the dance version woow I love it
I mean this dance vdo
tackey zaa there's another version????
Now, I will learn it 😻😻
i love twice❤Where twice Fans?
Tzuyu outfit is so comfortable and totally my style lolLove her fashion!!
@ 0:09 to 0:24 (look at tzuyu) that's me doing lots of projects at night that will be passed the next day.
NAYEON AND MINA (AS ALWAYS) ARE OUTFIT GOALS. I'm worried for their lives but I trust them! Jihyo Dahyun and Jungyeon are so pretty mygod.
Jihyo looks like the Youtuber named Venus (The girl who acts cute or doing weird thing and likes to cosplay) . I forgot her full name. haha
Their pants at the end of this video tell us how hard the dance is 😂
Wow!!!!!!!!!!  I love TWICE💚💚❤❤💙💙💛💛💖💖
Nayeon is breathing really hard, is she ok tho?
Choreography of this song is very difficult  i can see Nayeon breathes very hard
not related to this but what is jihyo body type? is it hourglass?
they dance verry well...i love my baby leader Jihyo ...
Honestly, I first thought twice sucked at dancing, and then I saw this thing jyp does. they first make the dances simple at first and rly amature and as the group gets more popular, the choreo gets harder :3 but not hating, i lob twice♡♡ *jungyeon bias*
Mint Puff wonder girls are the same they first had easy choreo, you'll see twice growth in years to come music-wise and performance wise cause they are very capable.
I have been listening to this song on repeat since yesterday...this one I think is my favorite one by them.
momo can kick me on the face
Jeongyeon's part in the second verse is soooooooo cute 😍
Deys Yuniar i acually memorized it 😂
r c that part is my favorite too
I love Tzuyu's outfit❤️
this is their hardest choreo so far
Momo having the time of her life with this choreography though 😍
Ikr I love it 😂
100% why I like this song now
Jihyo dances so well even with her knees hurting TT
I love it the dance is so energetic so well made and the song is truly a masterpiece ♥♥ thank you twice ♥
Tzuyu's part is so catchy. The whole song gets more catchy the more I hear it. I can't wait to see them perform this live
hax hax ikr that jirit jirit tho!
At first I wasn't really sure of this song, but honestly it's such a good song ! I love the chorus 🙌🏻💖
i forgive the song because of the choreo
I don't like this song but it keeps getting in my god damn head😂😭 also this dance move is much harder then all of there songs. I don't like twice but I appreciate them a lot and they worked really hard on this dance love and I love this dance😍
Mylove Sungjae it's like she just finished her PE class
Btw who else notice Tzuyu 's pants? Or just me ? :D
At lease we get see to see her legs. 😊💯👌🏽
Jessie Kim her legs though..so sexy..my eyes on.jeongyeon..i love her way of dancing,so energetic and graceful..
I don't understand why people don't like this song likeeee
this has to be their best choreography
Look how MoMo dance ! Please stick ur eyes to MoMo she is really damn good ! Executing , Bouncing thats hips to the steps . MoMo is \u003c3
chaeyoung looks so good what the fuck??????? she's looks about 25 whaaat, she has found her feet with that short hair finally and oh my god, that lipstick and THOSE LEATHER PANTS with THAT shirt I'm weak, she has honestly never looked better than she does in this video imo I couldnt stop watching her (and I'm a mina stan) ahhhh 😍😍😍😍
Dancing is great!!!  I'm anticipated to their performance on May18.
Momo is super awesome! The choreography really shines her dancing skills. Now if everyone was dancing like her, my goodness, all the fans would go even more crazy! Haha
Momo 😍  your dance was superb 💞
I love the song and i like the choreography!   They are the prettiest K-pop Group ever!
dont really like the song at first but after 15 minutes, i found myself  'signeul bonae signal bonae tirrittt tirritt tirrittt tirittt'   lol 😂😂😂 the Choreography is fun indeed!!
Before... I can dance all their songs... but this one took me alot to watch and learn XDD
why do I keep my eyes on sana throughout the entire song without blinking my eyes a second? 😍😍😍
저만 이곡 좋나요..?ㅠ  I like this song
OMG...so good..I just love it... the best choreography for Twice... can't wait to see them on stage.....Lets go Twice !!!
Everyone gets in the center for long seconds.      I love this choreography of them the most now :D    special mention for Momoring, gurl you are slaying in that plain white shirt. damn!     ps. I love casual Twice (for the nth time haha) *jjirit jjirit jjirit jjirit*
this song is catchy but just less high note  , dance break , cooling down part or maybe rap
Cooling down part? You mean the bridge part?
momo needs to chill. she distracts me .i cant stop looking at her ughhhh 😬😬. btw im not a once nor a thrice. im just a supporter ✌
Wow~the dance step is so good,it's kinda boppy :)...I love it❤,Twice fighting❤.!.
swear to god mina most adorable human being in earth!
Indonesia once in here🙌🙌  I like this song💞💞  I like this choreography and i thing this the best choreography of twice❤❤👍👍  sorry for my english bad..
for me this is unique and cute MV love it. #RealOnce #Fanboy
I'm from vietnamese. I like this dance very much
I noticed how Tzuyu has to bend her knees just to stay on level while dancing. AMAZING.😂😂💙💙💙
I really like this song and dance
Omg they're so good💕😆
I don`t like this dance and music.Because this is like Girl`s Generation.
Damn I really like this choreo fighting twice❤️
JYP foreign line always got me. Both Twice and GOT7. But my Bias will always be in Kmember. Jaebum and Jihyo ❤. Leaders got my heart. Love all of them tho. JYP NATION.
Sharlou Sarande GOT7 are my ulti male group and TWICE my ulti female. BAMBAM and SANA got my heart ❤️❤️❤️
why people don't like this song? for me when i heard it for the first time it's pretty good when i listen to it like a few times more this is my jam now LOL JUST LISTEN TO IT A FEW TIMES!
Im not a fan but this is awesome 😍
Momo's outfit is the most simple yet looks amazing 😍
did Sana make a mistake at the beginning? Love the choreography❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I thought the song was catchy from the first time I heard it... I think people would know if they actually listened LOL.
My eyes are just glued at Tzuyu. And momo slaying the brown hair~
her hair color during the sixteen era \u003c3
momo is my bias but dang.... ninyo looking good
This is my fave choreography from them ❤ I wanna learn this so bad
My god Mina is so beautiful 😍 that I ever seen in my life
i dont like the song at all but the dance makes it 1000× better!!
the best! 😍
The song isn't that great but love the choero excluding the wae part
Momo this is just a practice youre working so hard
I'm new to Twice. What's the name of the girl wearing red shoes? I want to marry her.
that's Dahyun😍
Twerk it like 모모!!!! 😍😍😍
sana baby 😍😘😌😘😍😘😌  at first i got confused of the song but when you listen to it again and again, youll surely will get hooked 😉
These dance practice videos are as attractive for TWICE's fashion sense as they are for the performance and choreo.    And OMG, Sana's hairrrrrrrrr!!
3:19 someone's knee hit the floor so heavily
Momo's dance on point! I really love jungyeon's part 😍
Jilee Lab mee too. I love Jeongyeon part
Nayeon with this hair color really steps up her game \u003c3
the ever energetic sana 👏
this song is addicting
They're gonna do the 2x speed version on Weekly Idol next week!! RIP Nayeon.
mrpahjun     Can you just please use your common sense? It's just an inside joke.
alyssah yango noo bc she has mentioned before how exhausted she is after dancing to signal & you can see that she's panting the hardest out of all the members after the dance
twixsus why 'RIP Nayeon'??? 
to me this is TWICE best choreography
At first I did not like the song like really , but after hearing it hundred times , I found myself singing and dancing to the song ,
But i wasn't prepared for chaeyoung's outfit
I love the fact that haters just come here to write hateful comments and want to piss ONCE off, it means they care about TWICE, can't ignore their existence.  Now I know why anti is also considered as a fandom, because they help promoting the group too.
All of twice song is the best, that is for real once like me, in the first place the song is unique for me but i listen and listen to it till i know its meaning. Their Dance, Music, i mean all is good. But i love jihyo and nayeon's part.
I love Jihyo.
chaeyoung stans! where are you?
our baby chaeng is so underrated 😤 they can't see how gorgeous and talented she is. Just looking at her face all day is enough for me to keep living tbh 😍😂
Tzuyu you are the best Twice we are the best
alyssah yango of course she can. You can watch those videos which Tzuyu is singing Live, you can really say that she can sing. Sometimes it's just that JYPE doesn't give them the right song to sing.
alyssah yango wtf she can
BELLS LOVEIY BELLSLY she only can dance, she can't sing
if i do this dance i think i can lose all my arm fats already
I love this choreography!
I love this dance! This shows twice's dance ability's, JYP did a good job here.
This choreography has so momo in it ..  and i like that
If another group had this dance and lipsynced people wouldnt even care, but people would have hated twice if they did.
I love it!
the dance is lit! 🔥🔥
that is the best dance 😍😍💕💞💞
I like this more than the video clip  Love yah twice
Jeongyeon never fails to slay
My super pretttty Chaeyoung😍😍😍😍  And my Jeongyeon tooooooooo😍😍😍😍
seems like they only focus on the choreo rather than the song. that sign eul bonae signal bonae is a bit off and the whole song itself is quite meh. so..... no.
that's true
The song is not as good as their other title songs. It's kind of like cupcake with sprinkles but with no frosting (If you didn't get it, it's fine because I suck at metaphors). I did not expect the choreography to be this good though, it kind of compensates the blandness of the song. lol I dunno, who knows? I might actually get into the song after a few times listening to it because it's the same case with Knock Knock.    Edit: I like the song now hahaha
Momo and Mina look amazing of course
you can see that momo is more confident in this song, cause the dance is harder than their previous ones, she slays even if i hoped she had a dance break but it's ok
I love this group so much
momo and sana and jeongyeon killing it as always
Another piece of shit. Lack of talent and skill + jyp another crap song. Shame on you twice
Momo just slayed the whole choreography
i like this song more than their past songs i dont get it why they are having so much hate for this song.
not sure if it's the filter or they are using over exposed yellow light...but i love how the shoes sounded so in sync
I didn't expect about this, it's looks so hard 😥😧💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
i like the song and their dances😍😍
this is BOP!    fulfill with energy~  the dance makes this song 10000 times better and catchy.
Aina Chesse the vocals too are on point. 😍😍😍
Choreography is on point my guy 👌
Same Tzuyu is my bias and my bias wrecker is Sana and Jihyo
I love the parts that jihyo and jungyeon sing and they are very cute
I think this is better than knock knock😍
Tse Yu Tsun agree!! this is actually friendly to my ears
I think this is the best song and of course the best dance of twice ❤️❤️ they're really suited this song 😍
I love the song!💯! The choreography is so cute and unique❤️!!
why so jungyeon the only one wearing shorts
Once the Twice Was Born ikr
Why do I always end up watching momo? She surely kills the choreography.
Twice: Let's wear jeans and don't tell it to Jeongyeon     at the practice room    Jeongyeon: Okaaaaay?
There's something about Twice that really fascinates me. They always has this kind of aura that not everybody can have. I think I kinda uderstand now why jyp choose this members to be part of Twice during sixteen. Everything they do just naturally comes out beautifully without even trying so hard.
no haters no life True. Everyone can sing and dance by just practicing hard but aura and charisma isn't something that can be gain by practice.
Kiri I'm a girl but maybe the reason why I stan Twice is because in my opinion, they're different from all other girl groups (I never actually stan girl groups before even though I love kpop)  Although every groups are surely great.
👍👍👍The song and the choreography are too match to be true!!!👍👍👍    👍👍👍Love this song more!!!!👍👍👍
I personally like the song it really stuck in my brain,  I think I just dont like the mv it feels me waird...
I personally like the song it really stuck in my brain,  I think I just dont like the mv it feels me waird...
everything is perfect about this song  ♥_♥
This is way more better than the music video
Yaaas! Im gonna break my house from dancin to thiss♥♥  (not that i know how to dance but whatever)
I don't know, maybe I'm miss looking there area... Where the chair in this room? lol
first i thought  this song didn't match with twice but now i always hear this song lol
I am a love twice
Black hair suits jihyo the best. She looks so pretty. ❤️
It looks so easy but it's not 😂 my second favorite choreography from jelly jelly 💓
Tzuyu is so busy at the front of the song😂😂
i want to clear things,if you all say that twice improve in singing i will say THATS RIGHT. But if you say twice improve in dancing,they aren't because twice is ALREADY SLAY in dance
this song keep repeat on my head...I think i will fail on exam this time😂😂...Please someone help me...My exam start tomorrow and i cant focus...Someone help
questions:  why is sana and tzuyu the chorus instead of jihyo and nayeon or jungyeon  why jihyo has such less lines as a main vocal  why this song has no high notes  why this song no climax
1. the chorus have less lyrics than you thought  2. i think jyp want deliever jihyo, nayeon, and jungyeon's vocal in this song.. as you see their part was the strongest key in this song  3. yes this song doesnt have high not and climax.. buat its still good overall
thrices be saying the choreo is so easy, tbh twice is getting more powerful omg just wait until everyone sees how twice uses their LIVE  VOCALS and HARD CHOREO to slap thrices ON THIS ERA BYE BYE THRICE BTW THANK U FOR DONATING ONE VIEW IN THEIR MV MWUAHH :))
love the song, love the concept, love the mv, love the coreography. I love you twice! Tzuyu!!!
The hardest choreo 'till now.I really like it :)  P.S : Isn't Chaeyoung too much girl-crush here? :)
呆呆布丁 she is my queen
liked before the video started :3
this is also what i felt when i first heard Red Velvet's Rookie. i was like 'wtf is this song? why did they  comeback with this song?' and when i play it again and again I love it. hahahaha Fighting Twice! 😍💕
i need to say again.....SANA is sooooooooooooooooo CUTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! omg.....her voice is so cute cute and cute.QQ  SHE IS WONDERFUL BEAUTIFUL AND PERFECT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  by the way, she is my.
Wow this is the best twice choreography 😆💙
the difference between dahyun's dancing to momo's is so cute tbh :))
Wow even they're choreo changed a litte
I was hoping to get tall but you're hoping to get small ;; cut your leg and give it to me xD hahaha
Dino Rye I wish I was your height! I've always wanted to be shorter then I am
kpop stans are so basic lmao
not my favorite first impression of a twice song but so far i'm loving it! ONCE \u003c3 TWICE FIGHTING!
Im inlove with sana and tzuyu    Loving jungyeon's legs and shorts
Momo got all the center time she didn't get in Knock Knock. Thank God 😍
the choreo are ridiculous in chorus but overall its okay..
They're sooooo cute. I love the dance. The new song always sounds better when you listen to it more than once. I love you Mina, Sana, Tzuyu, Dahyun, Jihyo, Nayeon, Momo, Jungyeon, Chaeyoung! I love you all! 💗Twice
The choreography is good i just dont really like the song. just go bacj to cheer up era pls
For the entire video I kept looking at Jihyo because I was afraid she would hurt or overexert herself during the practice
this is good 😍😍
mina nearly forgot the formation in 2:05. hehe
Damn sana really caught my attention.
Tzuyu's smile at their final pose kills me everytime :D Such a cutie!
I'm thinking why chaeyoung choose that pants? haha well she still cute but I feel like nayeon looks like maknae and chaeyoung the oldest with that pants. Well ok     even that pants distract me in funny way, this choreo is seriuosly good!!
I love Twice with Like Oh Ah and Cheer up.
the Dance part for jihyo it reminds me of taeyeon WHY.. is it just me?  anyone?
FOCUS ON MOMO ♡~  She's the best one in the dance in my opinion, i love how she dances in this choregraphy fighting momo fighting twice 🌸 love you
Marie Kookie Momo is the main dancer. Dancing is her passion
Why are they the most beautiful persons ever
shiukte they have an aura
TWICE best song and choreography so far! 👍👍👍😊❤  and can't stop looking at momo and jihyo dance. 😊💕  Jihyo looking so good with black hair!🙌
TheGreenFiretruck yup this style suits her very well. The hairstyle and hair color makes jihyo even prettier. 👍😊
Patrick Malaluan Yeah when they started stomping on the ground I was like oh crap! Didn't expect them to come as strong as they did haha 😂    At least JYP gave her the positions where she doesn't really have to bend her knee or kneel.
Chris C yeah, let's hope she doesn't put too much stress on her legs.
Patrick Malaluan yess i like this song!!
Seems quite a few people are noticing Jihyo more this comeback. She definitely needs more love ☺️    I just hope she takes care of her leg since this choreography seems the most difficult so far.
This choreography saves the song! So cool!
Jihyo and Tzuyu slays this era. 💓
the choreography its not easy as we see from mv haha!   its complicated btw haha
i'm appreciating the song more after watching this. the mv was kind of distracting, i think.
so in-sync 👌👌 this choreo indeed one of the hardest from twice . The song is so catchy tho . Hope everyone will give a lots of love for twice and signal 😘 Lets stream the mv and song fellow Once 👌
Look at my baby Momo showing everyone why she's main dancer! Her movements are so powerful and sharp, I can't take my eyes off her.
The color of the wall and floor is blending well with Jeongyeon's legs. Lol. hahahaha
lets wear something who dont show our body and dont tell momo.
why do i like itttttttttt?
Pink Panda OMG FINALLY SOMEONE MENTION ABOUT NAYEONS RED HAIR (people only seem to care about MOMO and JIHYO)
This is actually their best dance so far, I'm so glad to see them still improving 😍
JUST CAME FROM WEEKLY IDOL, the preview says they have part 2 next week and will dance to Signal 2x faster, IMAGINE THIS BOUNCY CHOREOGRAPHY BEING DANCE 2X FASTER \u003c3 It'll be so tiring! TWICE JJANG~
all of them are on perfect sync! 👌👏👏👏👏
Is there something wrong with the floor?🤔
Jungyeon's legs are so pretty 💕😮
I like this 😍
I like the part of jihyo and nayeon..😊
ishipmybias& biaswrecker yup I also cant take my eyes on her. Sana and momo looks very outstanding here.
wow the dance is really park jinyoung (jyp) style.
This song gets better every time you listen to it!! And the choreography is amazing!!
look at how momo is energetic and hyped. she probably enjoy this song because of the choreo and the lines that she got.
Twice keep slaying. this is the best choreography for me. i'm so proud of you my princess. A true ONCE always here to support you. Ti Amo Tanto Twice!
people are saying the choreo looks easy. its pretty hard from where I'm seeing. so many different movements!
Iori Cat  yeah I can see that sorry!!
Raikou Kim it could be easy if u dance alone , but not in team
syafi arfan Not to mention there are 9 members and they have to be in sync. It's pretty hard xD
syafi arfan sorry for saying this but this dance is easy for me but some of the movements are hard but still easy... I am a once...
i think because twice's choreo is easier than the other idol group but I can say that it is very catchy ❤❤
i am worry about JH's knee! Jihyo fighting 💪 we love u 💗
i really hope they will wear casual clothes like in the dance practice when they perform tho 😂 i prefer this kinda clothes than their stage outfit 💕
When u now realise Nayeon isnt da one to start the song like Ohh Ah,Cheer Up,TT,KnockKnock
i can't stop replaying tzuyu's part at the beginning
nayeon looks so chic with her new hair down and when she dances
Slay my Queens!! 😍❤
Oh my Sana😍
the only thing that i could do here is the signal sign, heart sign and some of those hand gestures during jeongyeon's part. omg why do i even bother. atleast i could do something signal related! :\u003c
Can't wait to see their stages for Signal !!   I don't really like the song at first and after about 3,4 times now I think I'm addicted to it LOL  Love the song and the choreo so much !! TWICE fighting ~~~
OMAH!Twice Comeback!I love your songs Twice!hahaha Proud fan here pls make more songs 💓💕💞💖
the 3k dislikes didn't got the SIGNAL haha
Tzuyu dance is progressing, she is perfect.
i couldn't get the feel for the song when i saw the music video but now seeing the dance practise video is just great :)
the parts when momo and mina sing alternately are so hot
Chaeyoung looks amazing😍
this is just. im-
love nayeon's part ! the hairflip ! the lineee too 💖
Tyuzu's twirling around in the back is soo adorable...    btw.. love the stomping sound :)
lol my grammar doe
please do anticipate more amazing twice choreographies in the near future. lmao but bruhh the choreo was so littt
Love you all😻💕💕
You can't deny that TWICE are great dancers. This choreo is so good.
fighting..twice  i thing is you amazing.  i love  your sing.  i like your music.  #jyp verry good.
Jeongyeon's legs is so white that it's almost the same color of their background tbh
I've been waiting this for a long time and it's  right here!!
I didn't like the song at first
I think this song is much better than knock knock but i cannot understand why did this song have too much complaint. And knock knock has love from people
The moment you thought it was an easy routine = MINDBLOWN
I love this comeback  but Im the only one who do among my friends
as soon as I saw this I clicked the like button real quick
The best choreo! I love it :D
perfect!! \u003c3 you can tell they practiced hard^^.... love twice and signal!
Being very honest, there are many parts to the choreo I love and the girls are executing very well. But I could do without the excessive love hearts that seem to be thrown in for the sake of it.
wow Sana fits them jeans well ;)
Mo Mo is really dancing queen in Twice  Tzuyu Dance is dancing princess  I really love Tzuyu abd MoMo Dance.  Strong and Energetic and stand out the most
Sana it is buitufil
The best is when Nayeon Mina and Momo dance is so intense
the best chareo 😍😍I really luv it 💖
The best is when Nayeon Mina and Momo dance is so intense
This play 2 times the speed may be asthma
The dance is great but the music ... not really good as the others songs
jihyo isn't my bias but DAMN SHE GOT ME DROOLING!!! she stands out the most for this comeback imo.
and my girl, momo though! she be slayin those moves.
my bias jihyo is pretty and her dance is so good 😭😭😭😭😭😭💖💖💖💖 even tho she had injure in her knee 😭😭💖💖
Wow they all look great but Chae for me really stood out! Def one of my top choreos they've had \u003c3
*Naeyon always loses to Mina in line distribution XD*  *WOAH Momo and Jihyo are grear dancers*
I've been scrolling down the comments and all I see are positive comments 😁 compared to on Facebook, a lot of people said it was super easy and it wasn't difficult at all... every has different opinions but there was a lot of them. I feel like they haven't even seen the dance 😂😂😂 it's actually so fast paced
You can really tell that Momo is a born performer she just commands the stage when a song is heavier in cherography ! great marketing strategy on JYPE's part with their japanese debut so close SIGNAL's emphasis were placed on the japan line as well as Tzuyu who japanese fans really love! Japan will catch win of this comeback quickly so its already some form of soft marketing before their debut, which is just smart!
Nico Nico Nii influate the dance XD
this song so good better than knock knock but why most of the fans said it's bad... but i agree on one thing tho i hate how nayeon got only few parts and she's not in the center as much as their previous songs I WANT NAYEON
Every member slay😚😙I'm confused who'd i pick my own bias🤔They're all dancing queen🖒👌
they didnt tell again jeongyeon to wear long pants 😂
no one talking about chaeyoung thigh ? she's the shortest but i think she has the best thigh 😍
This is why I love Twice
It's not easy because when their dancing it have a impact
im inlove with jihyo's hairstyle
jungyeon look freaking cute and beautiful... her part is my favorite ❤❤❤❤❤
all of them are so good!.. momo slay!!
i love their ending pose, foreign line and Korean line 😂❤
This choreography is so Cool than I thought...Still waiting for more versions tho..BTW TZUYU WHY SO CUTE AND PRETTY I'M SO PROUD OF YOU FINALLY YOU GOT MANY LINES..
Well. that was intense... I like the dance... :)
fuckkk i think i have a thing for short haired girls... anyways this is one of those songs where you have to listen twice(no pun intended) to actually like it
Wow their choreography has improved a lot, maybe because there's a lot more happening? Either way I love it
I'm so falling in love with choreo❤❤❤
i can see they are totally exhausted at the last moment . Great work , girls.
The chores is awesome!!! But I hope they wear knee cap when they perform tho. Take care twice. Once will always be there for you!
the 'knock knock' sound of the shoes is satisfying af
TWICE is known for their catchy songs and cheerful choreographs. sadly, this song is ruined by bad video clip. first time i watch the MV i kinda feel disappointed because their trademarks are rarely been seen, only two segment for their entire video. and that stupid pause for the segment in the jungle that is totally unnecessary. if the director really know how to embrace these girls choreograph, this song will have much warmer response. i hope their performance on music show, like music bank, inkigayo, music core and the show will boost this songs popularity. dont get me wrong, i prefer SIGNAL choreograph over TT and Knock Knock
I like theirs dance very much, tzuyu fighting
woe ive been singing this since yesterday sorry lol
So neat. Keep improving the choreography. We onces will always support you all. :)
the  most part in this dance i like 'sana' and 'nayeon' part ^O^ \u003c3
Minari my love....!!! pls don't cut your hair.... let it grow....  wait....??? ' let it grow....???'    🎶let it grow, let it grow...!!! 🎶  hahahaha.......  #Waley...!!!
Jihyo stand out in this practice. I can't stop looking at her😊😍
i am loving this choreo 😍💖 ps. NAYEON IS SO PRETTY , I CAN'T 😍
Not loving the song yet but I must say that this is their best choreography so far. But I just can't stand that they make so much hearts. Hahahaha. Looking forward to the liver performances. Hope they improve.
I thought it was easy.. but damn i was wrong... Keep slaying twice
Momo's having so much fun dancing this ^^  You can tell she's really passionate about dancing, giving it 110%   I like the beginning with Tzuyu running behind them, but it looks like this could be a really tough dance :/  I hope they don't feel too exhausted after... Doing x2 on weekly idol is going to be really hard. xP
Gosh!!! Love them💕
And thrice be thinkin twice before sayin that this is easy
there was this person who had given a bullshit dance ranking on another video of twice, in which they kept jungyeoun in the last rank. I think he must have got it by now. all of them are dancing extremely well!! 😍
My only real problem with this dance is that it doesn't feel like they're in a group. In TT it was very group oriented and the dance could only be done with a group. With Signal, most of the time the focus is on one member of the group and you could probably pull it off solo.
This song is difference to another twice songs
Dahyun i love you so much♥♥♥♥♥♥
Obessesed with this song love it ❤️
THRICE: Their songs choreography are not even that hard.  TWICE: Say no more bij.
Wow at Momo being so energetic compared to the other members who seems like they do not want to be there. I don't even like Momo but I commend her for always giving her best in dance even when she sucks at singing. Mina should do the same, she seems so lazy nowadays
Gracie C. Mina is sick, she has a colds.
I just wanna commend all of Twice members for bringing us another way of entertainment when we're bored af. We can just watch your video/mv's all of them are great.     As you see, Tzuyu improved a lot ( I was focusing on tzuyu ), while I was focusing on tzuyu I noticed that they give all their best on this Video not only tzuyu that Improved but all of them, I like how Sana do her steps it makes me wanna love her forever (does it even exist?).    Once Here From Ph.
In a dancers perspective, this dance is strong however the delivery needs power. I want you guys to look at how Momo dance and compare it to the rest of Twice. Momo's movement is more powerful than most of them. You want everyone in the group to have the same and correct FORM. If a form is not executed properly, it can be very crucial and awkward to the eye.     Side note : I love the choreography , it's cute , sweet and strong in so many areas it's just that tye execution is sloppy in some parts.
sugarmilk28 I agree, obviously she has dance skills therefore her moves are sharper and more nicer to look at compared to other members. It's so wrong to put down the other members, just because they're weaker when it comes to dancing. If we turn the table around, and compare them with singing skills Momo will be the least skilled. But we won't talk about that, since we should respect every ones weaknesses and strengths 🙄 some people try to complain about everything
Poly Smore I understand what you mean but to me Momo's powerful dance doesn't make it unbalanced. The others are not lacking it's just that Momo is a way better dancer. For example when someone dances beside someone with more experience of course their energy will be different and more experience.
iLoveKpop242 I know that Momo is the main dancer . I'm not comparing but I want to set GFriend as an example . SinBi is the main dancer but you won't notice it until someone told you that she is the main dancer. All of the members know how to get the FORM of the dance correctly and know how to Level their movements. Sowon is their weakest dancer but because of her correct form and her correct distribution of power , it makes her a great dancer.     Side note: I love twice. I consider myself as once. I know twice since SIXTEEN. My bias from the beginning until know is Chaeyeon. But even though my bias is Chaeyeon my eyes are glued to Momo.
Anzuul linjuu I understand what you are saying. I agree that in a live stage we should not expect them to dance precisely and be able to sing with their vocals being stable. But this video is a Dance Practice Video. They can breathe and not worry about their vocals. On a postive note. This dance really is better than their other dances.
Twicebiannn that may explain why Mina is lacking in energy and movement at some part of the dance. I kinda expected a lot from her since she has a background in Ballet (YES I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING TWICE SINCE SIXTEEN SO I KNOW THEM). Just to give you a context of why I expected a lot from her , Ballet dancer has a lot of advantages from a dancer with a hip- hop background. Ballet dancers are required to put power and control since every move must look graceful and the form of their movement must be accurate.    I believe that they really need a break. It's a rule for dancers that if you have an injury , REST. Dancing with an injury can cause a more major injury that can result to permanent disability.
i can stop laughing when i know the spoiler from tzuyu and nayeon funny dance Vlive
Nayeon's hair looks so good and all of them looks good in their clothes. They are all pretty
dahyun is brighter than my future
oh the choreo is nice... it's fun and creative i think
in my opinion,  this choreography is the best of Twice choreography.
tzuyu's doing too much work in the beginning  tall maknae's disadvantage😂😂
I think they might struggle a bit with the choreography while singing since there's so much moving but this is so cute
They are really cute!!
I live for jeongyeon's bouncy hair!!
you can clearly see .  how momo stands out in dancing .  momo keeps on dragging my attention 💞💞
I think best choreography of theirs so far, and it makes the song a lot better
Just like all their previous songs, the choreography is always solid
Nayeon has less part to dance
Jungyeon, I'm rooting for you
When I first heard it it wasn't really getting to me apart from the fact that Momo got the first line 😄 but after listening to it so many time after it got really addicting like every other twice song and I really think the choreography makes the song much better
Momo i love you so much♡  The dance is perfect♡  Twice fighting♡
I can't help myself because I'm paying too much attention to jihyo rather than the other members 😭😭😭 I'm so deep right noww....
2k dislikes! I bet that those who dislike this can't dance 😂😂
I said only one thing...  Can you imagine Jyp do all the cute parts??  Hahaha♡ I LOVE YOU JYP♥ THE BEST FOREVER♥  ONCE&TWICE FIGHTING♡
i love twice freaking much but i just don't prefer the song 😭
oh my fvcking gahd Momo ♡.♥
i love the dance...and the song...can't wait for their comeback stage...😀😁😊
Its sososos amazing
I think they are dead if Doni Coni ask them for 2x speed . . .  This is more intense than their prevvious song's dance~    Anyway, glad to see Jihyo could dance freely like that~~~    TWICE FIGHTING!!!!!~~~~~        P.S : When the maknae knows fashion better than the stylist, as expected Chaeyoung the artist~~
am I the only one who thinks this song feels much faster with the choreo ?
God am I the only who love tzuyu's outfit?😍
dahyun . You are god (love her hair)
omg i freaking love this choreo
i've been waiting for thisssss
Official NiTu Wanna see you dance this 😊 upload a video dancing sigbal with pure energy... sing it stable! go! i challenge you!
Where are u now haters? Wanna see you watch these 9 lovely ladies dance this so gorgeous.... It's freakin hard!!! 😱
I like how there's more movement in this than their previous choreo.
we are proud
This will be 2017's dance craze especially the Heart dance. Trust me :D
momo's energy could supply us electricity for a lifetime!
so damn right about that 👍👏
haters gotta hate..  thumbs up for the  girls
can we just watch this dance video peacefully?! and please don't compare their choreos to Gfriend, Red Velvet and Blackpink.
introduce you to the new main dancer, QUEEN NAYEON 😍
I'm not a ONCE but I love Twice and I love their music. When Signal came out,I thought it was actually cute and bouncy.    This dance video only proves that their dance steps are not kinder like and are actually hard. Amazing! Go Twice!     Carat supporting Twice!
You're welcome. TWICE deserves as much love as other groups.     P.S: Respect for Jihyo who apparently had an injury. :)
thanks for supporting!! :)
i think this is the most fairest line distribution among the twice members from all of their songs ever .
who's gay for Momo cus i am
Yulia Astrie everyone gay for momo
무대랑 같이 보니깐 훨씬 낫네  ㄷㄷ   listening to SIGNAL with this choreo  feels much nicer .
love you twice
Did anyone notice Mina's pants is the same as what she wore in TT's dance Practice? It looks so good on her tho.
Blare S lol i love when kpop idols wear things more than once unlike Western artists who only wear something once than never touches it again
My girls slay with these jean 💗
I Thought it was easier than TT now I'm like TT!
People weren't kidding when they said Signal's choreo would be a little hard, goodness gracious
Am I the only girl that finds Jungyeon attractive? She looks stunning af I can't even
Why is no one talking about Chaeyoung? She looks so cute and sexy with those clothes!🔥Gosh give the girl some love!💞 #HeartsForChaeyoung
Nayeon wearing pants is just 😍😍😍 and I'm so proud of Jihyo for losing so much weight even though she wasn't that fat before 👏🏼👏🏼. Ahhh they're all too cute and pretty ❤️❤️
Haters will say the dance is easy because they can dance it 😒😒Bitches how about try singing and dancing at the same time......Also send a video of you dancing and singing signal to jyp lets see if those haters can even become trainee in jyp😂😂😂
Exo saranghaja They dont need to sing loud anyways cuz im pretty sure they are tires because all of their shedules are packed
Oh wow their dance is super hard i guess.
Namjin is Real they're singing but i can't even hear some of their voice. and they out of breath
jungyeon need to keep this hairstyle\u003e~\u003c she look so pretty
1st time listening : Is this even a song?    2nd time listening: Awww, it's okay.    3rd time listening: Wow, Twice is getting better.    4th time listening: Ohwmaygahd! My Hearteu! and my Braineu(lol)! This song is stuck in my head!    Good song , Twice. Don't mind who is bashing you, you girls are awesome. Many more blessings and songs to come😘.Onces are Daebak!
I'm in love with the foreign line 😍😍😍😍🐰🍑🐧👽
shniame she got the least lines lol
I also love the fact that Jungyeon got more lines 😭😍 soooo *happy* for all of them 😄
shniame its like jyp give more lines to the foreign line. i love it so much!!
Momo I love you
Mina and Momo's part are my fav part
I'm going to made a tzuyu / nayeon focus video with this one! sub me if you're curious ;) before I done it with Jelly Jelly dance practice
i'm an full time ARMY since my boys debuted, but im supporting twice also, when i first heard the song i was like 'hell no' but i LOVE it now, ARMY supporting TWICE🖤
This is the first view army so in love twice
Zoe GSM thank you!!
Stop being rude, she is being nice
deep blue it's not all. Some of us are hating twice & other artists  and I admit it
okayyy we know that all the armys in the entire planet support everyone and anyone and we understand just stop saying it everywhere it's the million time that i read these kind of comments.... -_-
this my favourite choreo of theirs!
y'all crazy if you think this choreography is easy all the while performed by 9 people
lol i bet your sis rocks anyway, i cant even stand on my feet without falling for a second
lol true dat. yknow, im not even a once, it's just their comeback trigger a massive fanwar between the fans and the antis in my country. so i just wanted to see why the antis (thrice, right?) say they cant sing nor dance, but what im seeing right here and a couple of their live performances are proves that thrice are wrong and need to go out to socialize
yeah can u imagine the mental and physical burden but the girls slay it anyway
exactly, to harmonize and sing needs a lotta practice and they nail this tbh
The dance is really hard.. My little sister is having problems on MinA 2nd verse and Sana Jirits because she can't do the hearts thing xD
theres still more other powerful and beautiful dance  if you say in kpop 
Exo saranghaja im not impressed with blackpink's choreo as well, for their type of song it doesnt have impact. Not like blackpink's fandom is any better to be preaching here but thanks for the opinion 🙂
Diệu Hằng Đoàn Thị  you call me a haters just because I say their dance are not as powerful as blackpink's dance? Hell how sensitive you're. I hope you once start to think positively and not tell all people who doesn't like twice's songs is a hater!
Omg TWICE improved so much. They can dance more powerfully and that makes the song more awesome. \u003c3
wow the choreography sure is hard but it never stopped twice from slaying! TWICE HWAITING
K-pop Bear   Really I learned the dance in one day 😂
my bias is that short pant's girl💓hahaha
omg I can't they're are just soooooooo adorable!
the song sounds better than the official MV. 😊😊
I like Nayeon's outfit! when I repeat listening to it, it keeps getting better and I'm realizing it is cool and beautiful
this is not the best song of twice, but it is the best choreography
Well that's your opinion. I think that this song is great and it's super catchy. The choreography is lit too.
And please don't think that I don't like the song... I like it it's catchy af but for me it's not their best song
TheNine AreMine What? You haven't like BlackPinks (Playing with Fire), Prisitin's (Black Widow or Wee Woo), or Red Velvet's (Rookie)??? These are some recent girl group dances that are legit fire
I love tzuyu's outfit \u003c3
Momo is an amazing dancer! Sometimes I thought that her talent was wasted in twice, but I was wrong... For me, she's one of the best dancers in kpop right now. And talking about twice, yeah, I don't like the song, but if they have so many haters is because they're really relevant, so good luck Twice!
Wow the choreo is REALLY FAST! I mean, Jeongyeon slipped at 2:31 😱😱😱 And Nayeon was panting at the end too 😰😰😰 Mina ALMOST forgot the choreo, too. She was taking a breath and got distracted a little bit at 2:07. But great choreo! I couldn't take my eyes off of Momo 😆😆😆 Sana and Jihyo too 😍😍😍
I love twice
The dance is so energetic I wonder how they will sound if they sing this song live.. Oh well
this is easy dance. and ordinary song too (without highnote, hard vocal etc). would they still lipsync?
애니 youtube don't worry it doesn't like you either
Same here its a catchy song and there is a reason its doing well oversea's too.
Jasper Cruz like yeah idk why everyone is bitching abt the song not being good. I loved it the 1st time i heard it❤️
Well, I don't especially like the song but I have to admit that this song is easy to stuck in one's brain. The dance is not extremely hard (it uses strength alot) but it is good that they all dance while some of them singing instead of standing by, it is a group dance not solo dance so I really like they move together 👍🏻
I love Jeongyeon's part!!!!
i love mina and momo part. they slaying this song.
I didn't like the song at first but now I can't believe how much of a bop it is
we love character development.
The problem of the MV is on the alien, not cute nor cool.  If it is replaced with Teletubbies, ET, or even Kim Soo-hyun, it would be much fun.     If you drop your earlier expectation, the song itself is fun and addictive.
IKRRRRR I WAS THINKING IT WASNT THAT GOOD, but then after listening 10000000 times it's awesome
the choreography resembles a bit on knock knock.. just sayin
they wrekt me ol omo😭😭
jihyo the best leader!!!!
So glad that Jihyo get to dance on stage after a long break
momo with sweats is the biggest turn on xd
why does other people saying that this song was not good?😕    its really good~ i love this song~😌💓❤
Jihyo is the best👰🏼🌈
Seeing the choreographies always make the songs sound much better \u003c3 Sana looks great
why do people dislike them?😠😠
so yeah its official. youre my wife now kim dahyun, whether you like it or not.
It's good to see that Momo looks very confidence with this choreo
this looks kinda easy!! i wanna learn it soon😊💚
MOMO's dance make this mediocre song a lot better :D those moves are flawless , definitely she is the best dancer in Twice
HaRemBae i read it again and it can easily be as I understood it. 'pathetic to watch'  or pathetic is really pretty much the same but if it is as you said some are not as energetic, I can name one I guess either way she still wouldnt look as good as momo no matter what, some just cant dance at momo's level.
can you read it again, its no their dancing what im saying pathetic, i said it is 'so pathetic to watch' what i mean is like they are not giving too much effort in dancing especially , nope not gonna name her you can easily see who is who ;)
HaRemBae you really had to use pathetic to describe others' dancing when they are better than a lot of  non-main dancers female idols. I also agree momo is on another level but that description is too much.
I cant really take my eyes on MOMO, the others member's movement are so lackluster so pathetic to watch, compare to MOMO over the top accuracy and flawless moves
Owwww, Momo😍😍😍  I love you so much❤❤❤, her dance is hot🔥🔥🔥
Génesis Vera ikr! whenever she does the tingling dance and sways her hips 😍
its not that I hate twice I Think They Really Need to Improve there voice and dance
Jeongyeon is so gorgeous because of her hair! I want to see Jeongyeon with a Long Hair!!
I love this choreo, its COOL! Thank you JYP 😍 tingling tingling tingling 👐
Jeongyeon, the only one with shorts! Love it! Lol  love her hair now tho 🔥🔥🔥
ahgase here to support this great song!!!
Twice: 'Lets all wear pants and not tell Jeongyeon!!'   Still love those legs tho ❤️
the choreography tho \u003c3
JYP are amazing😍😍😍😍  this dance is powerful and cool😍😍😍  Twice fighting♡  Once is here to support our 9 beautiful girls😘😙🙌💪❤
i love this so much dbnsjssnsn
for me the best part is tyuzu and sana
while others hating this song, here I am repeating it the whole time. everything was lit esp the pre chorus and the choreography slayed! 😍
the song sounds so much better when its not the MV style cutting
i really don't understand why people have to tell others which fandom they come from or bring in other groups when showing support for twice. It's ok to say your own opinion but stop trying to speak on behalf of your fandom not everyone from your fandom may agree. just keep it as an individual statement how hard is that.  If they are trying to fake harmony among fans come on we all know that's not true. Rational fans are able to voice their opinions in a way that will not create a bad impression of their fandom, which is by the way not done through bringing in their idols' names when commenting, because god knows how many immature fans there are out there.  And if they are bringing in their fandom just because they think it is important, well it really isn't. If you were making appropriate comments why does it even matter which fandom you are from. It's just not important.  Shouldn't the comments be relevant to the video instead of other groups?   In my opinion this act would leave a bad impression on your fandom,  especially when you comment with malicious intention.  That said, I am not against defending your own fandom when other people try to degrade your idol. After all that's what fans do.
I love Sana,Jihyo and Momo
So proud to be ONCE
every time I listen to signal, I feel like I'm listening to the mr removed version 😂
dahyun has that kind of prideful expression that makes her so cute but when its her line or she's in the middle or sana's chorus she acts so cuteeee
momo slayed this choreography💜
I am you guys first favorite fan I really really love you guys
Jeongyeon's legs are like goals.
Jihyo have an injury right? Why she dance like this
twice: *lets all wear pants/leggings and not to tell  jeongyeon*     *they saw each other in jyp building*    jeongyeon: why all of you wearing pants/leggings?!    twice: bc you're so gorgeous with shorts ( in pants/leggings too ) 😛    *i know that this is so corny but i just imagine this conversation of them. idekw lol*
i can't 😕 this is so commondly.. and i dont think this song in 2017
Momo and Mina part is the best
this is my current jam right now :)
*Jeongyeon*    The first reason why I watch twice.
aaahhh Mina that sexy lady! 😘
when you trying to focus on your bias but then... momo...
Chaeyoung is stunning 😘 Indeed they're all...
not a once but for some reason chaeyoung attracts me???? idek why lol
Iam a buddy , and i love this song .
I don't know why, but the synchronized stomping of their feet sounds so satisfying to me.
bye bye my twice...
when I was at school having exam ,my mind keeps playing signal and I can't think about the formula 😂
This is what you call easy dance? Bye haters my girls improve a lot they will stun you haha
Omg my girls be slaying my life 😍
I'm falling in love 😍
I like Tzuyu sana part 💙💕💙💕💕💙💕💙💕💕💙💕💙💕 love you so much TWICE ...   ONCE SUPPORT TWICE 💕😘😘💕😘💕😘💕😘👍👍👍👏👍👏👍👏👏👍FIGHTING
I love how they naturally doing shampoo ads while dancing....
I'M SO EARLY❤❤❤  When I saw the notification I click AS FAST AS I CAN😂😍   LOVE the dance yasss👏👏👏❤ #TWICEFIGHTING 
I like the choreo they have! Just hope it's not painful for Jihyo
momo is nailing the dance!
is it just me or does jyp need to renovate the studio hall? looks worn down
SONE supporting the *next generation's* nation girl group. This song's quite catchy,yes?
SONES ARE MY FAMILY Thank you~ Good luck on the next comeback. Fighting 💕
Thanks for the support!! SNSD fighting!!
Aw you are so nice! We are really excited about snsd's comeback too!
thank you so much we will support gg comeback too💕
Now, every cover dance before this video have been worse. The Twice's girls dance it with more powerful and energy.
Imagine they get an offer to shooting anti-dandruff shampoo CF with this dance
Jeongyeon has the best legs of them all and Momo has the best body of them all
i love Signal and their choreo make it even better! love it~
Trying to follow along only to realize I'm not a good dancer Dx
Focus MOMO all the time
The thing is they tried to make it into a catchy song. This could have been like a normal nice melodic song. I mean I like the part before the chorus, the jihyo part. But the chorus kinda ruined it for me. But oh well its nice
I'm crying right now 😭😭😭 because they showed  who they are😭 this is the powerful step that i can see everyone they improve sing and dance...NOW TELL ME ! TWICE haven't talent??
This means you are eleven years old no problem i dont have a problem with kids you are lucky
They so powerful when practice but not in live ;(
This looks Harder than other twice dance (except LOA tho) but still gonna learn it bcs it looks easy maybe let see in 1 week
I love Momo😍😍❤️
the sequel to cheer up dance practice: let's all wear pants except jeongyeon (again)
I really love the song better with just the dance
The choreo is so good! I think this is their best dance and Momo is on fire!
watch this dance ver has more view than the mv lol
Love the part of 'jjirit jjirit jjrit'😍😍
much easier dance steps hope that they are much stable now
This video proof why Momo is bae af 😻
momos moves are so clean
Nayeon is the best. I'm in love 💜  This dance is so cool! I hope I can dance like them 😢
*wow Dahyun was doing so well in the last few comebacks and now she has like 1 line wtf JYP*
they seem to pant very much in the end of this dancing video . ^ ^'
i thought they said the choreography will be hard.. but it's still cute
Pattyyy i think there's misunderstood here... what i mean is their choreography is not that hard in negative but...... even though it's not hard the choreo still cute which is positive
cute =/= easy choreography  Sure this has some cute elements incorporated in it, but compared to their previous choreographies, it's a lot faster and bouncier. They're doing so many movements while switching positions so often, I'd imagine being out of breath after.  PS. not having cute actions doesn't always equate to being a hard choreography (ex: Big Bang's Fantastic Baby).
i love you TWICE ALL THE WAY FROM PH. DONT LISTEN AND IGNORE HATERS. WE LOVE YOU SO MUCH!!!! -ONCES \u003c3
Mina in that white tee and ripped jeans is killing me
Damn! I'm digging this! Best dance ever I saw by Twice. Good job girls! Jihyo please don't dance so hard. I'm worried TT
This time should be Jungyeon and Jihyo's era! I dont know why but suddenly this comeback makes me fall in love with 2 of them! \u003c3
The song sounds infinitely better when paired with the choreo. And can we talk about how Minatozaki Sana freakin' killed it?!🔥💕
I dont like Nayeon part in Spoiler.But i love that part the most now.I think i need much time to learn this dance.
The choreography is actually pretty cool and fun to watch.. I hope the song grows on me, too
I love Nayeon's style :)))
This has become my favorite dance by twice ❤️
I learned this dance in my bathroom and I was sweating so much. I was hella tired afterwards but I kept on practicing so I could perfect the dance 😅    Their other dances are so much easier 🙈
Leila BB Uhhh I didn't say it was hard? I said it was twice's hardest dance, compared to TT and Knock Knock.
seriously the song is dope ✋✋✋✋ especially jihyo and nayeon parts 😍😍😘😘 (sorry for my bad english)
Get ready twice to dance it in faster version..😂😂
let's all wear jeans/pants but not tell jeongyeon about it 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
lol i had to
Heart Bustamante i was about to comment this because i always know that this kind of comment will be here.
Cant help but focus on Tzuyu at the beginning! Lol
my bias MOMO is the best
they look more mature.. so gorgeous!!
mimo matching with black pants and white t. i love girlfriends.
who's MINA biased here?
Rilence I was looking at jihyo and nayeons legs too 😔
Jihyo inspires me to lose weight 😂 srly this song is so addicting
Jihyo is the only one who did not kneel. all of them kneel
nayeon gave much effort on dancing her parts though, thats good!
am i the only one who like this song?? 😂
2yeon & SaMo, are you guys trying to break your necks? 😂 You guys dance so powerful, please be careful 😘💕
I like the dance steps but the music i don't or maybe it will took weeks or month/s before I will like it just like their other songs. It took me weeks or month/s before I like them. dont hate me Please it is just my opinion.   I'm not once but I like Momo and Nayeon
i can't take my eyes off from MOMO 😍
I love it so much❤️❤️❤️
who else secretly tell Jihyo not to dance too hard or it's just me. lol
all of you are so amazing!!!!
am i the only one who wants to focus on the choreography but keeps on drifting my eyes on my bias? like seriously i have to play it over again just to focus hahaha
While Momo's moves are powerful   SANA puts so much energy into her movements, and gosh, and the hair flips  No Sana No life
can't stop listening to the song then the dance video came out. Now, I can't stop dancing it either
the dance make it impossible to sing live..
the sound of their steps in sync is so satisfying
pizza sucks without u I know right
am i the only dahyun stan here?
too much changing positions. i guess it will be hard for weekly idol random play dance.
Its amazing how Momo looks so sexy while dancing with cute their songs ❤️😍
Twice ís the best
SaTzu❤❤ and of course all of them look gergous with casual clothes💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
Omg I'm going to master this choreo!😍 I really like these steps 0:45-1:20 and 1:49-2:04💓💓💓
who wear white shoes are my top5 bias💓
I want to invite Dahyun, Momo and Tzuyu over a pajama party after watching this. ♡♡♡
'the dance is easy' sure jan
Sooooo.......i just noticed this...i was watching alot of live performances of signal and noticed that in the end when they pose...jeongyeon has a different pose than other...why is this? If it was a mistake then i would see this once only...but after watching this and dance performances live...i think there may be a reason for this...but im not good at theories so...i dont know what its for but maybe there are theory makers out there...make a vid anout this..FAST
I can't even pick a bias up until now :'))) btw love this new songgg
I like the dance. Im not once, but i like this dance. Better, not hard, not easy. Hope to not lipsync:)
At the start it was a little weird but somehow after it was amazing !Good Job
HAH! This is actually a fast dance. SEE? TWICE CAN DO FAST CHOREOGRAPHY! Suck on that Thrices.
I thought 'Do It Again' had a hard chore but dang..... 'Signal' tops it now lol 😂  Gosh I love their dances! K-pop choreos are always so much fun to dance to (not just Twice) 😆😆
this is the best choreography from twice for me, even if the song is not that powerful as the past ones. and chaeyoung's outfit 👌
I dont know why but my eyes always look at jungyeon's legs, she is so PRECIOUS!!
Better the dance. Hope to not lipsync:)
Is it weird I find 1.48 - 1.55 oddly sexy and satisfying to look at? Jungyeon especially look so good \u003c3
gak bagus yang kali ini gak kayak yang lalu.this is last ranking in my kpop song list
Tzuyu got more lines than ever before and sounds SOOOO GOOD in this song  They improved a lot!!!  I love this song and its choreo!!!  チュウィを筆頭に歌上手くなってるし、チュウィの声めっちゃ好きだし、この曲めっちゃ好きだ！
Let's get this dance video over 25M views
When I found Jihyo cross over the red line I'm scared that she would like to fall down the stage Hope she  gets well soon 
Mina is so swag in this vid \u003c3
There's a part that looks like Lovelyz's Wow
Momo Tzuyu Dancing is really nice to see 👍
when they dance i so feel song ok
Why does sana looks so cute in what she's wearing. Omg bias stop please my heart can only take so much and  Jihyo listen I told stop trying to make me cheat on Sana. I'm trying to be faithful damn it 
Sana got lead dancer for a reason.... Watched her dance and Momo for 3 times and others 12 to compares and these two tend to danced better than the other 7.. i thought Mina hip part was a bit weak.
PinkyBumbum TTSignal i love how sana dance ,very charming and cute
jihyo shippers ??! where r u?
Tbh this to me is the one of the best songs and choreography💕twice fighting😍❤️love you
i love how mina and momo are twinning!! ultimate bias wrecker 😆 also the foot stomping at the exact timing with the beat is just amazing
I think signal is good song but not better than another song before. However dance is so cute. Please dont bash Monkey appa
I think this song shine more with the dance, because there is no long blanks and the song can show itself completely and perfectly, after seeing the performance in showcase, I feel the song is good~I like it, and the performance with dance is awesome, I have to say I can't wait to see their first stage in MCD~!! Love it!!:)
And yet people say only momo can dance lol they are so good i hope jype showcases their dancing more with a badass concept
Sana is taking all my attention
finally they comeback with difficult choreography  love themmm so much with that dance
Is it weird that Nayeon didn't start the song😂😂
i can't stop looking at chaeyoung's high waisted black skinny jeans, they look so good on her
chaeyoung was the only one to sing. SIGNAL instead of SHIGNAL
*Momo's dancing skill is no joke!* Damn. She moves so sharply, as expected to twice's dancing machine💕🔥👌
Their dance are so awesome!  The dance looks difficult and complicated!
will learn the choreo...I only know when signal bonae signal bonae jjirit jjirit jjirit jjirit
I love how my girl, Momo slayed the dance. And her body is so goals. That's my bias! 😍
Momo is sooo energetic!  That's my girl😉
How can someone not like Signal :(( \u003c33 They're kids who work so hard.
i love twice, i'm in love with the song and the choreography, but that dance or pose 0:22 is the sooooo similar to Sonamoo's I think i love you dance.
I really love their comeback it's growing on me
I like the quality of the camera used hahaha! (I don't know anything about cameras, sorry) hahaha! but it's just 480p here and it's just like in 720p. Do JYP make a lot of money? hahaha! maybe ..  this dance practice video is better than any of the dance practice video they made, (I mean the quality of the video)
i think this era might really be jeongyeons time to shine ✨
who fucking dislike this??!!
this choreo really suits momo if that makes any sense xD
Hey!... we got here before thrice did, for the first time in a long time ONCE actually watched a TWICE video before thrice. LOL
I guessed there dance improved?
Twice slayin' as always💕
It's one of their best choreo so far and it makes this song much better when they dance to it. MiMo anyone? Haha 😍😊.
I love TWICE!!!
sorry to say but i 100% think there is a move that was the same with lovelyz wow....literally
Time to learn the.. *shakes* dance... *pant pant* this gon' be hard!
Chaeyoung's leather pants tho seriously  It KILLS!!! 🔫😭💖
My chayoungie is so sexy omg 😍 I love the choreo so much, good job girls 👏💞
'Let's all wear pants and don't tell to Jeongyeon'
If the red line is for limit the stage I think that Jihyo and Mina have fallen😂😂   (sorry for my bad english)
Worth to watching. The choreography is so good.
first two days of listening their song: don't like it  third day: i should download this song!!! 😂
When nayeon's long sleeves are going down from her shoulders, it looks so f*cking hot even without her bare skin showing. 😍
twice in casual clothes is my aesthetic 😍
this is probably the best choreo of twice so far
Thank god ive been waiting since Ooh ah for a powerful cool ass choreography and now this might take #1 spot for dope ass choreo
This is actually a new and fresh look from twice. I'm happy that they lessened the cutesy moves and singing parts, cause those makes me cringe. I'm loving this comeback. REVELUV HERE SUPPORTING TWICE! FIGHTING!
All I want to say is....Nayeon why don't you wear your shirts properly XDD
chaeyoung is so smol :') nayeon & tzuyu are so cute in their pants (,,•́ . •̀,,)
I wish they will still stable when they dance this in live. I will stan them if ever
Jeongyeon caught my eye eversince Cheer up era. No matter how pretty the rest is, jeongyeon is always my fav.
where are tzuyu's fan ? 😭😭😭  I just see a little comment about her😢
This is best song I had from TWICE AFTER TT  AGREE 👍
when I saw they dancing. ...I love song signal so much...  love you twice. once😍
Can we talk about how good Jeongyeon looks in that outfit 😍😍 ultimate girl crush serving visuals!
Alifah Faridz Yes she really improved her dancing !
Alifah Faridz she is good at dancing
who is the choreographer May J or Lia ?
the dance is oddly satisfying ~
I feel a little bit gfriend (just saying don't be rude for this comment)
Tzuyu bouncing around at the beginning is just the cutest :3
Love their choregraphy
i love twice💞💞💞🍭🍭🍭😍😍jihyoo😍😍
Is this hard to twice
Here before million. ✨ who's with me?😂
They are amazing. I'm so in love with them. They did great this comeback, hope they are as successful as they deserve to be \u003c3
this dance is so hard and i'm so proud of them for slaying itttt
1:49 i love this part so much
They are perfect visual!!
Tzuyu is perfect girl 😍😍😍 My baby, you are so cute, pretty, elegant.   ❤️❤️❤️❤️
i thought it was just in the showcase but momo is KILLING this choreo.. she did not come to play. LOL
i love the dance!!!  so cute   i love twice!!  fighting!!!!
JYP why did you whitewash them with a filter? Comeon now.
I saw the music video yesterday, and I have to say it is one of the catchiest songs I have ever heard! Love the outfits, hair and make-up, and awesome super powers x #Fighting
momo's dance is so sharp i loike it so much
O.K. be honest... this is a really cool choreography! Thank you JYP for the quick delivery of the practice video. I've always loved the stomping sound they make.
TheNine AreMine those are two idol boygroups that were/are active as idols . Twice is an active girl group , unnies is a project group ... see where I'm going with this ? Unnies obviously will not be as successful overall  bc they're not a permanent full time group . That was a pointless point to try and bring up . However I can mention how unnies is doing better on the charts bc that's a relevant current achievement .
Aqsa hussain I'm sorry but clearly you do not understand, that person is not an unnies fan. They merely attempted to present a chart position to validate their opinion. And all I did was prove them wrong.  As for others achievements, that is never my intention but if I say exo is more successful them super junior ever was. It's merely stating that exo was more successful, not that suju is 'less' successful.
i clearly acknowledged that the other 'fan' of unnies was in the wrong. But there's no need to make unnies achievements seem less by bringing up all of twices achievements . Regardless of how many records they haven't broke , because they're clearly a project group with a new lineup the fact is that they managed to knock Twice from no. 1 . Now i like twice and i'm not knocking them down. Just stating facts. I wasn't trying to be negative to twice..
Aqsa hussain Excuse me but, your going to blame a troll comment that brought up the unnies on me?  All I did was 'reply' and politely at that. What I wrote was simply a fact to debunk the thrice comment.  I have nothing against the unnies... nor did I attack them, I *'defended'* TWICE.
TheNine AreMine you don't need to attack unnies bc someone bought them up . Unnies is a project group and is doing so well you don't need to attack them . The fan was childish to make that comment . Smh
the choreo though ❤❤😍😍
l think this dance is hard
Just look at *Jihyo* go! And she was battling a knee injury not too long ago. I am so proud of her!! Love you doll. 👍👊💪
nayeon my baby🐰💪💪💪
i already memories the dance
I love this dance ver so much !
Wait, for the whole time i thought they were dancing in front  of mirror...
Princess Candle yes, they were😂😂😂
ok it came earlier than i expected.. wow
wow i actually like the dance!! they are leveling up their game, finally! so tired of cutesy ordinary choreo w/o real substance
the song and dance look so fun.. I love nayeon part.. and get well soon my baby Minari 😢
the syncronization 👏
3:22 she look very tired,, 'ah ah ah'
oh WOW this dance is faster and more complicated than their other songs ❤❤  I like it
cringe as fk
It's so sad that no one really noticed twice's precious penguin and innocent black swan 💔 as if she is not part of twice, even if she gets more lines in this era. This breaks my heart 😢
i cant see their hands
for knetz : don't judge before you watch this dance video. PREACH 👏👏👏. cute concept your butt😑  for Fake once : don't comeback to become ONCE again after watch this video,we didnt need you😑
love nayeon true, how could 'ONCE' leave them just like that just because the music wasn't their taste -_-
the sync...so satisfying!!
Start with Nayeon part dance goes fast ⚡
i think thrices subscribe to dislike. they're fast. wow.
When you have to watch the videos 9 times, so you can watch them individually like a fancam😂    Deymmmm chaeyoung smoking in that outfit😳❤️
Aaahh...... Now It's clearer.. They're trying to get ride of the cutesy concept bit by bit.. The dance is getting harder, sharper, more energetic and some even get to be at the center more. No unnecessarily wink or booty shake or shoulder shake.. And JYP just started off with easy song.. Okkayy.. Good job Twice!
i don't understand why this song has many negative feedback -.- this song gives me gv
Others said that it was nice song but when I watched him pretty good and they were all good ... But something caught my attention was the momo from her super inergetic and the softness of the body .. good for him to go those main dancer ..
there's so many hearts in the choreo
0:39 is me in the shower when i wash my hair lmao
damn i love the choreography 😍
Wow, they breath pretty hardly after they danced. All those hard-working have paid off, A STUNNING COMEBACK
i know i love it very much even when i don't see it yet. so the first thing i do is click the like button :)
I loving every time I am listening to this,
*That moment when I thought that their dance choreo in signal is easier than Knock knock, but I was wrong this was the best choreo they had. So bouncy!* 😊
I only stan JYP Nation I love your name😍❤️☝️
I'm always love their dance video more than their mv. Because in here they look so casual, gorgeous and full of energy
i'm thankful for being alive to see:  -chaeyoung's 'hey!' at 00:12  -tzuyu floating like some kind of indicator  -momo and Mina combi and that dance at 00:35  -jeongyeon and chaeyoung center moment  -tzuyu dance at 1:28  -sana at 1:30 and 2:34  -sana and tzuyu 'jjirit jjirit jjirit jjirit'
this dance practice is kinda not the real dance practice one I mean their make up...clothes....and no sweat too
Am I the only one enjoying this more than the music video? :)
They are really amaizing  JYP i love you so much   Twice fighting
Dahyun's face brighter than my life 😍
This dance was very JYP STYLE LOVE IT!!!
MOMO the best dancer!!!
I love you twice😍😍😍❤️👏🏻
pearum  hahaha she's agree that momo is pretty😂😍
momo is back the dancing mochine of twice after knock knock era
Oohh i like tzuyu pants , but i love chaeyoung style here .. Hehehe
im so happy right now once you are amazing 101 million veiws in the first day of release wow ALSO I LOVE YOU TWICE great dancing
Who wants to sub to sub?
the song is so addictive ghaaadd😭😍
i love this song ! but nayeon not longer a center in this song.. whyyy jyp ?????????!!!!!!!! why ?!
Gracia Irena It's time for a change 😂
where are u jungyeon biased? ^^
Can't stop watching!  I love this dance! I Should learn this dance..  it will be a good work out for me! 😁
they must've filmed this video this morning, momo and dahyun have a schedule right now and they're wearing the same clothes wow. twice fighting ❤️
Beastly Bruise - filming for KBS2 Gag Concert
#미모 ᄒᄒᄒ Where are they??
最後膝蓋~空~很大聲 呼吸聲很喘~twice fighting love you all
Who's here before it hits a million? 💕💕  MEEE
Athena meeee
DANGG, Momo totally killed the dance, as expected our dancing queen \u003c3
Since this song is so fast and cheerful and has a good vibe THE DANCE IS SO FAST ( I can do TT and Cheer up, Ohh Ahh, Not fully yet knock knock) but this it will take a whole year Argh
If Im going to rank TWICE title track dances from hardest to   Easiest for me its..  1-Signal(no explanation needed😂)  2-Like Ohh Ahh(its quite easy but the song is upbeat some parts are just confusing me)  3-Knock Knock(freaking out part makes me insane😂)  4-Cheer Up & TT (for me both chorus are catchy and I learned it in a week)
GO STAN TWICE BISH Ikr!! imo CU & TT are the dance that makes you wanna join them immediately since its easy,cute and catchy while Signal seems fun ,bouncy and catchy that makes you wanna dance but since its quite challenging and tiring you only ended up learning 'jirrit jirrit' and NaTzu's part which is the most catchy 😂😂but I prefer these kind of dances too I also love it best one yet💕
Cupcakes XOX i feel like this is their hardest choreo alongside with Touchdown and I'm Gonna Be A Star? their second hardest would be Jelly Jelly
Yhen Sone How about ranking other non-title tracks too? Touchdown is really hard😂
agreed, i learned Cheer Up and TT in a day, and Signal's choreo is soooo good i love it :')
MOMO slaying me with that plain white shirt. 😍😍😍
Omgggggggn love this!!!!!! Tzuyu 😍💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓  TWICE slayyyyyed
They look good in t-shirts ❤. Twice, blackpink, exo, and bts are the group's that I always anticipate for their dance practices ❤
Is it me or 1:03 - 1:21 is so satisfying I mean its so super duper good
never clicked this fast when i saw jeongyeon's legs shining
I hope there will be a dance break since this song is quite short...hmm maybe they will perform it on special stage right😏😏
Someone tried to upload this earlier. It was blocked by JYP lol
Momo, Mina & Jihyo are hot even wearing just a white tshirt. I feel ugly😭
I must admit the song isn't par compared to their past releases but seeing the choreography with it. The whole performance changes my perspective and isn't that bad at all. It actually looks amazing. The dance and synchronization is on point.
nayeon was breathing so hard at the end LMAO anyway despite what others say, this choreo is very tiring. twice did a good job!
chaeng why so hot? 😍😍😍😍
Sana looks really good in that outfit
i actually memorised the dance before this came out 😂
This makes SIGNAL a lot better. O_O (maybe cause no awkward pause in between..)  All Twice songs kind of grow on you and stick in your head for a long time.
*casually clicks on the like button to make you hit 1K likes*
marshmello123 I agree!! It felt like a totally different song here! And i like it more!
omg we got this so fast IM SO HAPPY ❤️❤️❤️  love the choreo, especially in the chorus AS ALWAYS
i cant take my eyes off that penguin/black swan....😍😍  TWICE 화이팅!!!!!
I even prefer this to official MV ((:
Didn't momo and mina wear similar clothes in TT dance video too?  I'm shipping them
Man I want to learn some of there songs on guitar but I can't find any videos of people teaching how to play it well I've only found like one or two videos that do but it's just them playing the song and chucking up the chords I really want to learn some of the forms but twice 
Im happy to see twice stepping up their game when it comes to concept and choreo... Loving this so much...
i love to see jihyo recover from her injured 😄
wow they danced was really hardcore
they do heart sign omg 😻
Love this more than MV!!❤️
idk why there's no one commenting about Momo and Mina's similar outfit... and i'm out here like OMG MIMO💕💕💕
Jihyo is a goddess yet people still calling her fat like???? cant you see shes a body goals
Anyone watch this video but on V Live I did man it's such a good as song when I watched it the MV for signal it had  a 8 digit view 
I really like this dance and song, I'm so happy about the line distribution and that they are trying new things ^^ Twice fighting!!
I think the song is better with this lovely dance \u003c3
I noticed that TWICE's dances are getting very strong and they look so amazing— I love these girls
Mina you are so Beautiful!!!
@1:39 i think jeongyeon danced something like this?
Sana-stans, where you at?
their choreography keeps getting better
These girls are the only ones who can slay casual clothes. 💖    When God poured beauty on earth they catched it all 💖💕
i like this song..  Faighting Twice
Damn the hate is quick, haters stalk TWICE videos? LOL
Jihyo looks older than other members cuz of her matured face, but lol you can really see how short she is in here xD
I'm pretty impressed with this choreography since the choreography's for their couple songs have been much simpler :)
Actually, after hearing this song over and over, I think it's not that bad =)))))
I love Momo and Mina❤️
After watching the MV and after watching this, I still don't know what is there concept really is. Because TWICE said that they've never done this before. So I'm guessing it's not a cute concept. But dammit! 😍😍😍 they're all so 😘😘 cute
Nayeon-nie Soo beautiful 😚😍😍  my eyes only on her👁👁❤❤
tbh i don't like the song, will take some time to sink in :/
Twice slay yeaaah   Twice I love you sooooo much
hey haters, what else did you gonna say huh. 😏😏TWICE slayed it very well tho congrats👏👏👏👏👏👏
i only focus at jeongyeon with her new hair i love it! she's really stunning there!❤
Majda Benhamou i love satzu
Arlene Hisoler exactly lol. when I watched the mv teaser and album spoiler I was like if the chorus sounds like that it is super bad. I'm happy that it turns out to be just the intro.
CupcakKeRemixes i'm inlove with this song because of the chorus part
thus choreogaphy looks difficult, they did a great job.
This song is stucked at my head
Spectacular as always!!!!! 👍❤💙💚💜💛
Let's all wear pants and not tell Jeongyeon. And lol she's the only one who made heart at the end.
JYP has flunked with this piece. If it isn't because of TWICE, this song would have been a flop.
the beginning is really cute omg
This is the hardest choreography they have so far! So proud of them 💖
F S All idols lip sync because it's hard to sing while dancing. You will breathe heavily and it will be heard on the mic.
I'm a blink ...but I really love this new song
hi my fellow lisa stan
TWICEBTS GG of course we are friends!😂💖
Lisa My queen thx blackpink and twice are friends and I love it so blink and once friends too!right?
I love twice💖
Sana dances so well. I love it
My video first loaded in 240p and i was watching it like that for like a minute a half AND THE WHOLE TIME I THOUGH SANA WAS TZUYU WHAT THE FUCK  It really threw me off😂😂  but i mean lovers do look the same they say😍❤ #Satzu
Any other 'ONCE's here?
Momo is the best dancer out there
look like momo is a center in this song
I like their vocals here 💕
Brazil I love you twice
Momo is living every second of it xD
She's now my bias wrecker 😂😆
Joy Aquino Babo at the same time hahahahaha Joke
Joy Aquino she's not just cute you know, she's also HOT 🔥😍💕
Time to learn this ✋️ I'm not once but I can dance to all their songs hehe 😋😊
in their mv i give them a 👎 but for this dance practice video i will give them 👍,    please make a dance video to another song too especially 'ONLY YOU'
twice trash once again im sry i just dont help my self to added a comment like this but like i said i just dont want to hide my feeling about that song n mv
M. Slippers   this is my comment in 'signal' mv its about 8-9 hours ago...    i still dont like this song n this mv concept especially when all the member become an aliens in the ending part, its not cute at all its just looks so terrifying, its better for JYPE do not make a bad concept like this again in the future TWICE comeback n for JYP pd-nim please if you want to make a new song for TWICE again in the future please...please...please... make a better song for them, i dont say they have to change thier style to be like another gg cz i really like TWICE style 'color pop' so please JYP pd-nim in the future makes and give them a good song cz this song its really really bad cz honestly i dont fell the energy, the excitment, the impac n killing points like the others TWICE songs...  Btw i really like 'Only you' n i hope i can see thier sing n promote this song alongside 'Singal' in the music show...    p.s : MINA always be my no.1 bias but right now JIHYO, uri leader-nim its really ruins my bias list 😁😁😁😁    #StillLoveStillSupportTWICE  #BigLoveFromINDONESIA  #SalamUntukSeluruhONCEdiINDONESIA
im not forcing you to like the song but i don't think u should of given it a dislike, especially as an once. they get enough hate already and ur just adding on top of that hate..
sad alien im sry i just want to describe my feelings about that song n mv
i mean, if you don't like the song, say it gently and support them in next comeback. What TWICE will do when even their fans dislike their song and their hardwork?
I just love Twice. They've seriously brought me so much happiness. Although most people wouldn't understand how 9 girls like them could bring me so much joy, it's okay, because I know how much they mean to me and so many others and I just love them for what they do. Twice Fighting!! \u003c33
I cant find jihyo at first. Demm that hair. I want Sana's shoe please.
Who's here before 100k++ views?? \u003e\u003c Whatever they said about this song.. I still love TWICE 💕 Love SIGNAL 💚 Love TWICE 💚 Proud to be ONCE!!💃
Honestly they are working so hard and that dance doesn't look to easy. They don't deserve all this hate and I know they only want to please use their fans. LOVE YOU TWICE!!! \u003c3
Ommo,this dance is so good,I wonder why so many people hate them
really hate them so much !!  just kidding  not that much though ,hate their new song ,😇☺
1:14 can i be that checkered polo?
It is it I will swim to Korea to watch their live,
NAYEON is absolutely the ace ❤️
i love their outfits \u003c3
Jihyo: Jungyeon, where are your pants?    Jungyeon: oh I cut them and turned them into this cardigan. Nice, right?
It's 2am, but as soon as I saw the notification I had no choice but to watch
guys let's not talk about this, just enjoy this great video and wait for bts' comeback\u003c3
ika once because theyre immature...
Salman Khan lol why have to mention army?I am once but also ARMY and ahgase!
the only immature fandoms are A.R.M.Y
ikr.. she looks stunning in dancing
I can't see dahyun's hands so clearly. I like their dance because it suits them but I think it would be much better if they will perform witblh their own style on live stages.
i'm not haters but i don't really like this song~
Jeongyeon's hair is getting longer,Im liking it so far ❤️
I'm so happy I have unhealthy sleeping habits, if I didn't I wouldn't have seen this video.
same dance, different feels. MOMO my bias ❤
Is this video mirror ?
Mina is on fire! Slaaayyyy~ 👑👏  P. S Did you guys notice that the foreign members are all together on the bottom line in their last pose?  😄
I am absolutely in love with their outfits even if they're not even that extraordinary lol. Especially nayeon & dahyun!! 💕
am I the only one that like signal more than knock knock
love you girls
I LOVE LOVE LOVE this choreography    btw jeongyeon's outfit is great
WOOOOOW this dance is ultra lit!! 🔥🔥
i don't think this is 100% cute concept,i agree that this song really have a cute vibe but if you watch this dance video,this dance not really cute but swag (maybe just the signal sign and love sign that make the dance cute)
I think I'm slowly digesting the song but the dance got me like the first few sec :)
Even their weakest dancer is still good
signal may not be their best song, but it IS their best choreography. THEY SLAYED IT. ESP MOMO
Whenever I look at Momo the dance become harder 😂😂
75000+ views in less than an hour  ONCEs proving their love to Twice \u003c3
Im Yg Stan. But twice are getting better. Im happy for them and once 💙
I'm a Sana bias but this video makes me to stan Momo. sht😍😍
jeongyeon will slay everything she wear...😍😍😍
The dance is more complicated than before, but they are doing well. Good job, TWICE.
i love what is chaeng wearing so much! omg❤
I love signal's choreography!!! It makes the song even better to enjoy❤❤❤
lovely alka, it really does! It looks so fun ❤
Yhen Sone saw it. She needs plenty of rest tho honestly. I wish SoKor Once would give nabongs some energy drinks or vitamins on their fan meetings there.
But the signal showcase one is worse..if you watched it You'll see She's the only one panting really hard like she had a trouble breathing while others are just standing and smiling like nothing happened😢...Nabongs is really an official granny/ahjumma now...Still love her tho💕😂😂
Mxrxel being the oldest is hhmmmm I don't need to say it now do I? let's all wish for them to have plenty of rest
Mxrxel it proves that she worked very hard for this choreography
Twice improve a lot in this video. I like the way Tzuyu dance and her outfit.
Momo is perfect  i love twice
God!! I loved the choreography, well done girls~
i get it! if knock knock is connected in knock knock's video, Signal is connected in Cheer up's MV. The steps, The camera man, momo and dahyun's character in cheer up are there with the camera man.
Omg I rly love Tzuyu and Jihyo's part 😭😭😭😭 help me please
I really love it when Nayeon and Momo are dancing next to each other
I personally love their other songs more than this one but I feel like the choreography for this song is harder.
Awww I love the dance!! Who said Twice is untalented?! They must be blind ugh
the perfect group
the dance is sooo much fun!! when is their comeback stage? tomorrow mnet?
oh yay! thanks
OMG!! they just film this dance video today..
I got my signal now. tq twice😘
i tought this was uploaded hours ago
this song and dance tempo is fast. How they done it in weekly idol speed dance X 2.  let us see today😁😁😁😁😁
they didn't really showcase their dance in the MV but daaaamn! this is really good! they just keep getting better and better! :D     can I stream this too? ;) haha
jihyo looks good as usual 😍
Is no one going to talk about how gorgeous Jihyo is?? Like my eyes were cheating on Chaeyoung because of Jihyo my goodness..
Smol Chaengster ikr. I'm falling for her she's not even my bias.
Smol Chaengster, Mina's my bias, but I must say that Jihyo has always been so gorgeous even way before she lost weight-- she never was fat, though :(    I think there's just something extra charming about her in this comeback. She sang her part of the song so well, too! 🤙    All the members are just so charming! 🌼
This dance is much more powerful... it shows momo's dancing skill more 😊
I wasn't sure about the song when I first saw the mv but this dance practice is so cute and I do actually love the prechorus & chorus, it's catchy. I'll definitely be checking out a live performance now
you can say what you want but their Dances are Easy, cute and still brillant 🌈
Momo !! jokbal pa more 😂😂 grabe ang energy 👏👏
let me try this dance  .  .  .  *le flips hair*
once💓twice!!!  I luv this song so much!!!
Why Momo so Hot even she just wearing those shirt and trousers?😍
Love the intro
They couldn't vacuum the area where they removed the couch?
💕 the choreo! It's soooooo good.!  twice fighting! 加油!
I love twice for twice
MOMO goes so hard I love it 😭💗💗💗.
They're dances are powerful💕
not trying to kill the mood but is jihyo's knee healed? like I'm reading some articles that some choreo has be changed in order to accomodate jihyo's bad knee. I wish JYP gave her more time to rest, or at least just let her sit onstage like what fnc did to yuna during Excuse me/bing bing promotions ❤️❤️❤️
귀신달걀 jihyo is a hard worker and very professional, so im not sure she would want to be on stage if she wasn't able to keep up with the group. as leader she probably doesn't want to hold them back. hopefully she's giving it time to heal...
Who had learnt this choreography before this came out??
I like this choreo \u003e\u003c
I'm in love with Dahyun 😍
love how much more energetic this is than knock knock's choreo.
I'm in love with Dahyun 😍
I said that i wanted to learn the dance but... I take it back now.. It's too hard of me.
i cant understand why a lot of people say that jeongyeon is not a good dancer?? she danced so well here!!
Jeongyeon's trash why do people say that? her dance during the live version is so strong!! ig next to Momo even good dancers seem weak, haha
Uhh they're getting better and better. I can't wait for the time that Twice will make some different concept.  Oh! Tzuyu is turning 18 this June!!!!
I must say, I'm loving this choreography :D
Wow so fast dance ver 😲  twice must tired so many comeback every month  dahyun I love u  love from Malaysia   cheography so cute
Is it just me or it's kinda satisfying to watch momo dance 😂
when the notification popped i cliked it fast to learn the dance of signal
Can we just appreciate how Momo looks so sexy with only a simple white shirt and black sweatpants? #BodyGoals
I can't take my eyes off Nayeon \u003c3
That dance is so hard, nayeon is right and I can hear that nayeon is really tired at the end pose
I love this😭❤️
i will learn this
im loving chaeyoung's hair length like the way it flows omg!! the cutest mushroom hair ever
ReVeluv here to support Once 💖  OnceVeluv 💖
min yoongi jjang jjang man bbong bbong immature reveluv saying red velvet deserves more than twice but I don't care I want twice and reveluv friends
prescilla limsiaco reveluv and once can be friends if the fans wont spread hate :) cuz both groups are kinda close
the dance is really cute   i love you so much
whose your bias in twice?
Nayeon is love :))
All of them ❤️
Jihyo looks like chanmi \u003c3 she is really beautiful im happy to see twice so happy Once let's go \u003c3
The pop that Momo did. I commend it, she CAN get it! Also I think this choreo is great, amazing, everything is pieced so well together! And the girls hit on mark perfectly everything falls into place so smoothly.... At least that's what I think.
Although they got a lot of negative reviews for the song, this choreography is bomb!
I love sana's dance very much😭❤️
this is their most tiring dance so far I think? I loooove the choreo yaaas
The dances are so cutee   part 'jjirit jjirit' are really cutee
Can't take my eyes off Momooooo 💖
I am not going to lie. I didn't have a bias before, but after this I picked my bias.   Jeongyeon is my bias, I stared at her from start till finish, how can she be this beautiful plus her outfit is so cute. OMG a true girl crush.
Amal KHALIFA ✨✨jeongyeon is the best ✨✨ you have good taste
was anyone paying attention to momo's bare skin???!!!
When I want to diet I should dance this after 3 mins I would instantly lose weight😂😂
Yhen Sone yes i agree, the dance is very energetic 😆
yea you right... I used to cover Twice dances but signal is a next level at Twice usual level
machiii! I'm planning on losing weight this month so I'm just waiting for a tutorial for this & I'd do like 5 reps with 30-1 min pauses between each rep...  that could be a killer cardio workout haha
They are all great dancers ❤️
nayeon is always exhausted to the dance haha
can't wait for a like
i just let you know...hahaha
Holy shit jungyeon... Haha... Why you must wear that short pants tho.. I'm dead... Twice hwaitting i know it's hard (charts).. Huhu.. Himnaera uri girls!!!
why im always late...its already 15k...😭..but i love their dance and outfits 💖
when I first heard the song i was watching their mv. didnt like it. then others did covers and line distribution videos nd im loving the song. i guess its just the mv is too distracting or doesnt work out for me. but the song is good and catchy
ok tzuyu in the beginning pretending to be a ufo is the cutest thing ever
my goddesses..beautiful as always  NO TWICE NO LIFE
if you love  twice like and if you loved the new song signal (like) and by the way nice shorts onnie jeounyoung
I can't take my eyes off Dahyun💕💕💕
this comeback may have flopped but the dancing is thank god powerful compared to their other comebacks??
the hardest dance of twice so far I think? 1:49 my favorite part
Omg the dance is so good!!! I'm in love! I'm loving the song too!! TWICE FIGHTING! ❤️
finally!.. i waiting for this video.. 트와이스 언니 사랑해요😢😢😢
even better with choreo, i love this song ! !
there is no bridge in this song, right? (with bridge I mean the part that comes before the final chorus, not sure if it's really called a bridgexD)
0:34 my favorite part  sssssooooo cute~~~~~
their dance have improvement 💜
i dont know why not a lot people like this song. seriousy this song is really cacthy!
twice: let's wear pants based on the number of our lines
not a lie, they are improved a lot. but they have to improve more. I know they can do it.
There is no reason why not to love Signal. Twice fighting
jeongyeon i love you 😭😭
yeahhhh...here is the dance practise..
This song is better when I see them dancing.
#CiscoVibe #KillerFrost  thats happen when u listen theyre song second time..
#CiscoVibe #KillerFrost i love your name
whaaa I love this so much!  yesss! 💖
TWICE is amazing  I love this song and dance
so glad they still found a way to have to many kneeling choreo without jihyo doing it. ❤ I hope her knees get better soon
lets colour our hair in anything that is not red and not tell nayeon
nayeon: the dance looks easy but its not :p
You see her going back and forth across stage a lot too! Like dang I'm surprised at how she's the only one panting so hard at the end
NY panting slight hard at the end😢Also at The showcase she's the only one breathing really hard at the end..the dance is really hard esp for the eldest maknae😂
bby chaeng looks super cute tho with tht attire, cant stop falling in love with her since sixteen 😝💕💕💕
i rechecked after reading this comment hehe but i knlw for sure that she's the best legs
Orcus  Me too,I like Momo and Tzuyu.same thing with me.But I'm korean  I  LOVE TWICE!!!!!  oh.....I'm sorry....I'm little excited.  my name is yering.....😀😀😀😀😀😀  I am not good at English.but please read the reply.
Look at Jihyo, even if she has still a bit of knee injury, she still slaying the dance. That was so professional.
Who's eager to learn the dance already?? 😂😍😍
Wow I feel like twice stepped it up with choreo this comeback! They were dancing pretty intensely and their moves were sharp.
I need to learn this. Twice fighting!
i love it ♡♡
Yaasss Momo yass thats my dancing queen, she looks soooo good even with a tshirt and loose pants, they all look good honestly queens
I love this dance moves._.
ohmy ohmy, momo slayed this dance a lot!! 😍😍😍like sriously, shes so passionate and energetic when it comes to dancing. hahaha
lol the beginning tzuyu just like go across unnies and repeat
I'm proud that Twice's choreographies are getting better and better. I really liked Like Ooh Ahh but somehow I didn't like the rest as much as the first until Signal came. I hope they get better and better and show more of their talents and their improvement in the industry.
if haters are complaining of how easy twice's steps are, they should know that choreography is not about the hardness and hiphop vibe, its about the chemistry of the song to the steps. just sayin' 💕
pinkynas thrices remain thrices. hahahaha they're just so evil 😂
Jenny Yirumese if they complained, they're the true Thrice. Haha! This is the hardest dance so far from Twice! All organs are moving! xD
I love you
Momo is on a whole nother level
Oh my 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
How can they still look pretty despite those hairflips at Nayeon's part and Mimo's ruffling hair part??When I do that Its like I didnt get to comb my hair all week😭😭
i love Jeong's outfit
as a SONE i really love this choreography 🤙🏻 i feel like it makes me love the song even more 👽💜 (imho) (if you disagree with me just keep your comments to yourself)
Julissa agree.. Most of us here said the same thing. We love the song even more after watching the dance version
can we talk about their clothes? they look so beautiful and comfortable
Tzuyu looks so cute here😍& I love their outfit
Tzuyu on the start😁😘
love the choreo!
they really going all out for this choreo omggg i'm so proud of them ;_;
I heard my bones cracking While dancing it on the 0:52
stream harder even for their dance video👍
Jungyeon! do you really want me to make a sin? then why wearing short ghash
VIPLeggoOnceBlinkRVArmyQueensDay6KardExol  ApratimB I've been waiting for tzuyu's shampoo cf since sixteen why does life treat me like this
I love the hair cleansing part. Would have made a great shampoo CF. 👍
Definitely my favorite choreo from Twice! I love how bouncy and energetic they dance to this song. And finally we can't forget to appreciate them dancing in their casual clothes which JYPE didn't do to Knock Knock sunbaenim's dance practice. xD
I cant take my eyes of chaeyoung,she's so hot! \u003e_\u003c   lol nayeon at the end ^^
Jeongyeon is the only one wearing shorts... Again. hahahahahahahaha
okay so the choreo is so fast i think i cant dance this *dancing to tt
I just cant take my eyes off to mina and nayeon
so cute.I love it
i really love momo body.
In my opinion this song is really good, I don't understand the hate it's getting. Might just be a very vocal minority. I hope Twice do well on their comeback and continue to push themselves and experiment with their music and concepts. ONCE \u003c3 \u003c3 TWICE
I love this. Omfg.
they are energetic ♥
oh my beautiful talented cute humble girls i luv Twice 💕
everyone is so pretty \u003c3 Nayeon was panting after the dance. she wasnt kidding when she said the dance is hard for her lol
Its a hard dance after all :) cant you see it? they put so much effort in. Only real onces will support they're songs. According to our bunny nayeon it looks easy but it actually really hard. I agree with that 😌 Twice already proved that they have talents since their debut duh.
I wish to see they dance in heels
stream harder even for their dance video👍
i miss the girls in the practice room finally we get this
can't keep my eyes off to dahyun   she's so pretty
they think that we wanna hear the song more than once.
no wait. i rephrased it wrong lol. i mean i am glad they still think we do since the negative reviews.
well you clearly do since you clicked on it
the disadvantage of this song is too much 'sending sign, sending signal'? (am i translate it right?) at the beginning, it feels dry and plain those lines, that is why some fans might not like it. entering the song at 00:47 is good though. all i can say is that hope for next come back will be better than ever, wish the best for TWICE :) and hope JYP can give better songs to TWICE for next come back, it's ok if this time TWICE didn't win as much as before, give them lesson to prepare and be better for next comeback. for Hardcore Fans ONCE, TWICE need your support, never give up guys.
We are here to support twice
jyp pdnim : we need to use tzuyu height for good in this signal comeback  tzuyu : say no more pdnim say no more   also tzuyu : *become an UFO IN THE BEGINNING*
They worked hard, and I love this choreography:) well done BBIES and btw Dahyun looked so cute geh
We are here to support twice
They are cute!!!
Momo goes off. She snatched my wig, I am SHOOK
I think their skin is too white ... I can't see their hands ... and the light is too bright 😂😂
I swear if they didn't sing well to this 🙄
that ending is so cute tho 😍💖
Why there so beautiful
I didn't like the song at first but then... ITS ACTUALLY AWESOME WHEN YOU LISTEN TO IT A FEW TIMES!
bellezas de mujeres   I love you Twice
Nayeon breathing so hard at the ending pose haha, how cute. This choreo is my favorite of theirs yet.
Remember in the MV that they turned into aliens? There was a reaction vid which one said something that actually made sense after that scene.   Them: so they're aliens?  Him: Yes, since these girls are out of this world 😍  so much love 💕💖
Can they reshoot Weekly Idol and do this 2x?? LOLOL
I love this choreography💖💖  TWICE FIGHTING💪
If this didn't become a lit I will shave my head,
Wow the dance is actually hard! (Not the hardest but still it is hard!!!) And Momo, Mina, Jihyo looks so good!!! (Actually everybody looks good 😍😍😍) but Momo looks so so so so good!!! 🔥🔥 she always proves that she is the best dancer of the group ❤️ Hope they can win many trophies! They are falling in charts but i think they will rise again when they will appear on those music shows 😄 #TWICE fighting! #ONCEs fighting!!! ❤️❤️❤️❤️
Fake once's please leave  Thrice dont come near bE blind forever  we dont need you cause real ONCE'S are solid!!BOOOM
For me, This is the best twice's dance practice video! Love you 9 precious girls
I love this choreo no wonder nayeon said she was out of breath. Damn the loud knee thump at the end...I hope their knees are okay \u003e.\u003c
the end Nayeon look so tired \u003c3
lol... i hope its not only me but jeongyeons legs are same color as the wall.. she looks like shes floating
mina in casual clothes \u003c3
I think Dance verison song sounds better than MV, who else agree with me? ^^
#CiscoVibe #KillerFrost  me.. but im still like their mv..just dance practice more better
i love chaeyeon's and sana's outfit! they look so adorable \u003c3
The dance part on 0:44 - 0:53 is *LIT* I mean the whole dance is but I really like this part
aw Dahyun looked sad the whole time :(
minari  love you.  She is very pretty
Cant take my eyes off Mina 💙😍
Jihyo so beautiful with her black hair 😍😍😍
the bounce part at the beginning is so cute  😀
I don't understand why this comeback has so many negative comments and feedback like I don't see any difference between this song and their other title songs. And this choreography is so cute and smart!
No wait, after listening to the song for a few times I think the dislikes are because the song doesn't have that same pattern and part orders like in their previous songs🤷\u200d♀️
they so beautifil, i love you, 😘😘
Even the footsteps adds tunes to the music 😊😍
I love it😍😍😍😍😍
When you can't focus on watching their whole choreo cause your eyes kept going straight at Momo 😍😍💕💖
I think this dance isn't easy to copy. There are a lot part that must change fastly. I love this dance , also one of my favourite dance. And of course there are jyp vibe. Thank you Twice and Jyp you guys did a good job. 
Hard choreography + A lot of formations = Tired 😔 TWICE FIGHTING 🤘🏻 No matter what thrice says. you all are talented! ❤️
We love legends!
Nayeon ending up panting omg it seems that's a hard choreography but I love it how it just sticks mostly the chorus omg   I have already received weird stares from people cause I can't help myself to imitate that tiriling part lol
this dance 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
and i want to watch 2x speed of this dance 🤗🤗🤗 and cant wait for the comeback stage 👽👽👽👽
the song with dance is very excellent !!!  I love it😍😍😍
There's definitely fewer haters here this is heaven :D
who was watch this twice? me
Their improvement are like other groups especially the dancemoves!They really improved a lot!
I love you twice! FIGHTING! SINGAPORE FAN SUPPORTING TWICE 💕
Gosh, Nayeon's hair flips are killing me 😍
momo energy is to much
Momo looks like Song Hye Kyo when she smiles
Momo's flat stomach, chaeyoung's leather pants and nayeon's hair is all killing me!!!!! 😭🔫💕💖
Grandma Nabongs at the end~ HAHAHA
Try not to sing ONCE😂
hello thrices you came fast.
Momo dance machine~ wooooow asdsadad all are pretty \u003c3!! #MexicanOnce
*I want Crazy Version of this Dance* 👏
always support you TWICE \u003c3
O.o how are they so pretty
Lovely MV ..💝 Twice Fighting ..🙌 Love you Twice Girls ..😘
TWICE it's really grown up,the dance it's really good and they're voice really good too and the album it's REALLY AMAZING! TWICE is really big now..
Honestly the sick sucks in the voice parts where it says let you know. They really should of actually equalized that shit. Its very cringey. Good song other then that part of the song
Fighting, TWICE! Fighting, girls! Keep in mind that you will always be the best girl group JYP has! Saranghae!😙😙😙
I love the choreography 😍😍😍
foreign-line at the last part!!♥♥
This dance might be their hardest one yet. Cant wait for them to slay it on stage.
Edip Goktug Kumral should i try to dance it? :3
momo looks so pretty even with those simple long pants and plain white shirt \u003c3
My babies are slaying
Oh my god. *the sofa is gone*
r c I find it weird not to see the sofa in their practice room lmao
their improve the dance choreography...😚😚😚😚
Im so proud of Jihyo. Even that she is not fully recovered she can dance as well
Am i the only that always think that jeongyeon looks a bit like taeyeon??  She kinda gives off the vibe❤
Fake ONCE n Thrice: The song so flopped but their dance seems good thoReal ONCE: *Pretend to be shocked*
my favorite part of the dance is certainly jihyo's part!! she looks so good this comeback too ☺
OMG, I was watching the Live Performance and I said 'I can't wait for the Dance Practice' then this comes out.  HAHAHA \u003c3
this is awesome tho!
chae baby trying hard to be mature  but she is still the cutest thing in the world 😊😂😂
okay but did chae grow taller? she's catching up to dahyun and jihyo's height lol
Momo finally gets center position after the long waited era of Knock Knock.
Who's here before 1k dislikes bc thrice are fast af 😂😂
There is nothing more amusing then the sound they make dancing on the ground
I don't knkw about you guys, but don't you think JYP is putting them in too much pressure? Like they are coming back every 3 months now ever since their popularity shoots up, I mean they need rest.
I love jihyo and nayeon part ❤
I love that shoulder part
I think this is the fastest dance they have in all of their songs.
i like it tho :)
yeah i agree.. makes me think i wish some parts of the choreography could be a little slower to actually appreciate the meaning behind some of the lyrics. kinda feels like they're rushing through it :/
Actually momo is not the only a good dancer, Dahyun and Tzuyu also. Dahyun's is so clean 🤘🏻
3:01  Dahyun: *look at my dab*
They look so smol! 😍😍😍 And I love it! They're so adorable! WHERE MY SANA STANS AT?! ^-^
I'm so so so glad to see jihyo dancing again. Hope she has fully recovered
Twice in casual clothes 💕
jyp pdnim : we need to use tzuyu height for good in this signal comeback  tzuyu : say no more pdnim say no more   also tzuyu : *become an UFO IN THE BEGINNING*
i freakin' love the walk they do at 1:00
theyre all so beautiful fuck bro my wig is gone
MOMO please marry me..  nobody will love the same way I do 😍    IM GAY FOR TWICE
damn mina and dahyun is so pale i cant even see their faces
Momo shined at this dance 😍
i really love how chaeyoung dressed. TWICE HWAITING~!
lol at 2:05 mina almost made mistake.  and just noticed how cute parts dahyun does it and parts where they aim for popularity sana does it
yay finally their comeback song and dance are more mature!
I'll memorize the dance and dance it everyday, ahahahah! Who's like me? Or im the only one?
mina's so attractive........even with just white top and black jeans............................
when I see tzuyu wearing baggy clothes and still looks great they are all so talented
i have to say this song is good and dance is good too
Can ik why jeong yeon do a love shape instead of 'Signal' on the ending pose?
Tzuyu is so cute with that outfit \u003c3
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS SLAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY. This is Jihyo's Era. Look at her everything, from her head to toe. fllawwlesssssssssssssss go girrllllllllllllll!
I love that
I'm dissapointed, I hope their next comeback will be good
why mina looks so beautiful while just wear white tshirt n jeans 😭😭😭
tbh they look lovely even in casual clothes
This dance is perfect for my group's audition
I live for this !!!  They have so much energy in this ! I'm so excited to see them perform this on liveshows. like i literally wait on yt for new videos.  I know not only will they kill the choreo, but damn the vocals too ! \u003c3
Luv the dance💗💗💗👍👍👏👏👏👏
omgggg i love you chaeyoung 😍
They are so adorable😍
that intro part makes Tzuyu looks so extra 😆😆😆 I love her
The choreography is difficult to me tho but still nice 😊
always my queens :)
OH MY GOD, YAAAAASSSSS!!!! that jogging choreo is gold!!
halla grabe din kci ng steps nila huuuu hingal clng lahat sa Ending eh 😂😍😱😩 pero worth it din nmn eh
This song is gold ... Hope kk will bring them daesang TT
Youu don't do this to mere... When I'm about to sleep and I got a notification, I'm tired AF but it's Twice so Fk sleep
ONCE fans are too fast for the haters hehe
I love it when idols wear casual clothes in dance pratice. I especially like Chaeyoung's, Sana's and Nayeon's clothes with this one. Momo slaying the dance though!
i just noticed, Jihyo was the only one who doesn't need to crouch or sat down the whole choreo, i guess they're still taking precautions of her knee, because truthfully i'm impressed she recovered this quick and already dancing this hard choreo.
Why does the dance make this song sound so much more like a bop?
Their dance this comeback is a lit bit harder than their past comebacks! They worked hard 😢❤
this is so good ;;;
finally! i really wanna learn that dance!
I need to say Baby Cub chae fashion style so cool ...
Twice, twice, twice, as expected \u003c3
Jihyo looks stunning with black hair oh my god and their legs are so beautiful, I really like when they're wearing long pants!! Chaeyoung looks so pretty with her red lipstick ahhhh
AREN'T YOU GUYS ASKING FOR HARDER CHOREOGRAPHY? OKAY SWALLOW THIS. I want to focus but Momo won't let me.      anyway, we've known that Jennie is the fashion queen in this era. But i find Jungyeon is also have unique and boyish fashion taste. Go check her daily fashion or airport fashion. even jungyeon wears cheaper brands than Jennie but still looks cool.👌👌
no wonder Twice said the new choreography are hard. I can see it now. Good job Twice.
THE ENERGY. THE STOMP. THE FUN IN THIS DANCE. More of this pleaseee
Paul Ramos when?
I like this more than the music video! It's better without the alien and the awkward stop before the second chorus, and with the fascinating choreography!
YASSS SO GOOD!! This is my favorite Twice choreo! All the girls slay but I can't keep my eyes off of Momo aha  brb time to watch it a million times :P
they must have dance break
never been this early. Here at 189th view 😍😍😍
I can hear their loud breathing at end of the video hahaha
The dance for the chorus is so cute!!
Twice aka my soft girlfriends
I'm pretty sure Momo had fun bc the choreo fits her dance style.
Lmao all I can focus on is the STOMP STOMP CLAP CLAP JUMP AYYYYY 💀
Nayeon's flannel is so gay I love her
song is so much better than it already is with the choreo \u003c3
First time im this early
i think this dance is harder than previous songs....for me the easiest part only the tingling tinglng part....😁😁😁😁
Am I the only one who's satisfied the way their shoes sound when they step/stomp too hard??😂😂
2:40 and the claps
TheNine AreMine Same thats why I also want them to dance energetic and upbeat songs and I like this kind of dances and songs😂😂
Yhen Sone IKR, I've loved it since 'OHH AHH'.
I love their choreography very catchy and pleasant to the eyes also I love Tzuyu's chorus's steps \u003c3
Finally we can see all dance powerful , they can't dance too hard on stage , they might get hypoxia
I may be biased, but at 34 secs, I really like that move especially how Momo does it
The gurls should have a dance spirit like momo, even the dance is kiyowo momo still can make it so cool and energic😍
whose 2nd after tyuzu? 🙂🤗
No matter what people say, I think this song is really great.
omg dahyun and momo my bias wreakrt
i love the dance! my twice babies slays!
That messing the hair part bish are you trying you kill me
Love the choreo 😍😍
This is really their best choreo so JYP style 👏
the dance is so good 💕 my girls are so talented
i dont know why there's so much hate. I really like this song specially the choreography. fighting girls!❤💓
i wished it came out a week later though because they haven't even had their comeback stage on music shows yet. we need to focus on mv views so let's keep streaming!
Forget You right. they were so late with knock knock dance practice ....its a miracle this released a day after comeback
At the end Nayeon was the only one breathing heavily, I hope she'll be okay when promoting it every time on shows
i love this dance so much. so catchy!!! very proud of these girls \u003c3
I can't open the V app so I watch it here
This song is nice, except the 'Sign을 보내 signal 보내' part. I talk music not dance.
Momo slayed me as always.
This performance is best so far from them, can't wait for them to do it live
Im earlier than Thrices is this miracle??💕😂😂
cute love twice

I've been waiting for this 😍 the choreography is so good and Twice slayed in this 💖🤙💯
there is so much hand motion. pretty confusing. but at least their dance step are more hard compared to the other cb of theirs? and tzuyu so bz in the beginning😁
momo is my wife♥♥
My profile pic is me finding out there isnt a dance break

William Hampton Amaya i only learned the chorus of it
William Hampton Amaya i learnt knock knock after the week it came out. I will plan to learn this song
William Hampton Amaya same lol I will first learn the dance of signal then knock knock 😊 I find this dance challenging tho 😂😂❤️
Gotta watch this 10 times
180 views when I watched it 😍 this is an achievement for me asdfghjkl 😂
Momo really has got that X factor when it comes to dance!
gosh can't take my eyes off of jihyo-unnie  \u003c3
at the end pose down foreigners line up korean line
hairflips everywhere

Favorite comeback in my opinion! Dance is so good 😭

So early Where are all my notification squad at???
too early to see 1k dislikes :|
sana dances so well omg i couldn't keep my eyes off of her
taekooklords Same. She's so charismatic when she dances
I just dunno why they have alot of haters like honestly speaking i just can't hate them like they're so adorably pretty and talented ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Ann de'broglie don't apologize for bad english apologize for not speaking so i'm proud of you for speaking up 🤗😘
I am not a hardcore fan of any girl groups but I still listen to girl group's songs. At first, I do curious too, why people comments hatefully on Twice articles, so I end up watching their MVs, live performances and even other Idols' reaction to their performances. Well, I have to admit they are pretty cool. All their title songs are addicted and currently, I like their song which is the combination of their title songs and they cheer the members' name (I guess) in the song. Sorry, I do not know the name of the song. Twice fighting and their fandom too please keep supporting your girls. I'll keep listening to their music too. :)    Sorry for my bad English.
Marc Balaquiot  I'm very glad about that but why were you trying to hate them tho? o-o
breemitzy umm I didn't noticed that before lol
Ann Gwuan And she has a big tits that most of k idols doesn't have jks. 😂
I'm in love 💓🌚
And this is, the better TWICE.
JYP Always look for improvement! That's why I love and support them!
twiceeee I love you nayeonie, sana, momo, tzuyu
Wow this is lit
I think these is the best dance practice video OMYGHAD CHAEYOUNG CAN SHE.PLEASE GIVE HER SOME MORE LINES
BTS TWICE her singing voice is so nice - I'm used to her rapping but I want to hear her sing more!
love their outfits
I think they are wearing leggings
Can't wait for your comeback performance! Twice fighting!! 💓
ah yes now I can officially make a fool of myself by dancing to this in the back of my friend's car
I love you Twice😄😄I'm a huge fangirl😘😘
I love Momo ♥
Haters are so fast, there's dislikes already.

TZUYU, Love you so much❤❤❤

Rachel Machado I could understand the sentences in general
mo i Oh, I see too. I think your english is well... but the truth is that my english is weird, too.   Twice is the best! I hope you can see the girls next month when she go to Japon... it's so far away to me... Well, greetings from Ecuador 😊✌
I see. The previous word means that I came to watch this movie.  I don't speak English well…
mo i Sorry, I don' know what 'kita' means... so I asked you. I just learned to read hiragana, not kanji.
